Restuarant,review,labelLYLGCIqNQQrpMwOxJ1hlrg,I usually get the Arizona Smashchicken or the Arizona Cobb Salad.  Both are always delicious!  Sometimes they are really spicy and other times not so much.  I guess it depends on who is making it and how many jalapenos get in there.   The chicken is really flavorful; unlike a lot of other chicken sandwiches/salads where the chicken is bland and adds nothing to the meal.  I think I am the only person I know that isn't a fan of the Smashfries.  They are generally tasty; but I would far prefer regular fries.  I really like this place; but its a little pricey for what you get.  Lunch for two will probably set you back a least $20... its not too bad; but your $20 will go a lot further other places.,0LYLGCIqNQQrpMwOxJ1hlrg,Great place to grab a bite to eat when on ASU campus. I usually just order a kids meal because for the price you pay you get normal size hot dog; side of fries and small soda... which is more than enough to fill me up!   The staff at this specific location are really nice too!,1LYLGCIqNQQrpMwOxJ1hlrg,"could have been a 2 star rating because of the cleanliness; but realized that another chain burger joint charging $10 for an average burger didn't deserve it; especially when the burger is served with a side of sarcasm. not to mention that they are not community friendly at all. I asked to drop some flyers for the Grand Avenue Festival and they said no; not that they needed to say yes; but when I asked the manager to talk with the franchise managers about being a little more community involved and supportive; the manager barked very rudely \none of the businesses around here do that\""; which was a lie because just next door on college- Port Of Subs and the Cupz Coffee both allow people to leave flyers for their customers; so did the Hawaiian place and almost every other business around. I had to give this a 1 star because Arizona doesn't need another over priced; community sucker; who is not interested in creating a community; but just bleeding the money and running. he was so unfriendly and sarcastic that I didn't even want to place my order after that. i'll stick with Maizie's burgers anyday! I also heard the Grind on Camelback Rd  next to the Fenix eatery at about 40th street was the shiznitz! They said its hands down the best in town....on my way soon.""",0LYLGCIqNQQrpMwOxJ1hlrg,This place is right down the street from my office; convenient right? Well maybe if there weren't other burger choices. Have tried the burgers and onion strings; both of which are overly salty; and the onions extremely soggy with grease.   The layout of the place is also really awkward. You come in and order and them wait for your food....except the is no where to wait? You kind of stand between their expediter; others waiting and right next to diners. They need a much better system. Prices also seem a little high...$10+ for a burger; fries & drink.,0LYLGCIqNQQrpMwOxJ1hlrg,"Smashburger isn't bad. It's definitely quality for a fast food chain. But much like 5 Guys; Fatburger; and any of the other nondrive-thru burger joints; Smashburger just doesn't justify it's higher price tag (although this one isn't excessively expensive).   I had the 1/3 pound classic Smashburger and sweet potato smashfries. The burger patty itself was pretty good; not greasy at all. The egg bun is awesome. The special sauce is lame. I'm very sadden to say that Smashburger is the only place that's ever served me bad sweet potato fries. The portion is pretty small; the fries didn't stay warm for very long; and putting rosemary (an herb I generally enjoy) on them was awful.   The place is clean and the employees are very friendly. I think Smashburger puts a little too much effort into trying to look like its something better than it really is. I agree with the reviewer who said \good food costs.\"" However; I paid a little more than $7.00 for a burger and fries. Not bad; but there's so many options in the ASU/Mill Avenue area (where for just a few more dollars I can have better food); that I think I'm going to have to pass on Smashburger next time.""",0LYLGCIqNQQrpMwOxJ1hlrg,"Smashburger isn't bad.

Now me pass up a free meal; hmm NEVER!   So I mosey on to Tempe after sitting in traffic for about an hour (boooo) but was able to snag a great parking space and made my way into Smashburger. My first impression was that it was cute little place and yes it is a bit small but cute for a burger place. I met up with Christina; who by the way was fabulous. (Thank you Christina for inviting me) and she gave me a menu; told me about the place and let me know that anything I wanted was on the house. Gotta love that right? The first thing I asked her was \ where is the ladies room?'\"" In which she informed me that it was actually outside; around the corner as that is how the restaurants are set up on College Ave. If you could have seen the look on my face. WOW! So after getting what has to be the biggest bathroom key ring I have EVER seen; I made my way around the corner to the ladies room. Although it was well lit; it still creeped me out that I had to go around the corner and kinda towards the back. Although it was very clean; still not really comfortable with that but again I guess that is how it is on College Ave. 1 star   Any-who; I proceeded to order the following food to try out and here they are:   Chocolate Milkshake - OMG! I don't even like Haagen -Daz ice cream (that is what the shakes are made with) and let me tell you that this was the BEST chocolate milkshake I have had in a very long time. Think; rich; and oh so good. 5 stars   Smashfries- they are made with rosemary; olive oil; garlic and other herbs. I was a little bummed as depending on which fry I picked up it was either cold; warm; or hot. Not consistent! 1star   Onion stack - Now I love me some onion rings but I didn't get to try them because when I got them guess what; they were COLD!!! I was so disappointed. How do you get cold onion rings? Double boo!! 0 stars   Arizona Smashburger- I had the 1/2 lb one and it had habanero cheese; guacamole; onions; chipotle mayo and fresh jalapenos on a chipotle bun. (I did not have the lettuce and tomato but it comes with that too) OMG! That was one good burger. Nice and spicy; the bun was way to small for that burger but it was so good. A chipotle bun? Who knew! The seasonings that they put on this burger made it really pop. I was thoroughly happy with it. 5 stars!   I did meet Greg and Kirk; (Regional Vice President and Franchise Owner in that order I believe) and I did express my thoughts on my meal; especially my fries and onion rings. They did offer to bring me out more and apologized profusely; but I declined as I did not want to waste any more food even if it was free as I there was no way I was going to be able to anything else after that burger and milkshake. 5 stars   Oh and the best part of the night; I got to meet fellow yelper Alexander C. and his friend Erin and I was able to go in the back and smash my own burger! That was very cool! 5 stars   So all in all; a few quirks regarding hot fries and onions rings; but the burgers were really good. Its a little pricey as well so be warned. They are opening up a couple more in the next few months. One on 99th Ave and McDowell; and one on 20th St and Camelback so be on the lookout. These locations will have wine and beer added as well.""",0LYLGCIqNQQrpMwOxJ1hlrg,The list of fast food burger grows; and unfortunately; Smashburger is near the bottom.  If for some reason you get sick of Five Guys; In-n-out; Four peaks; and Lobby's; then give this place a try (although to be honest; Lobby's and this place are kind of tied).  I got an Arizona burger. It was good; no doubt about it. But just a bit pricey. A 1/2 lb burger + fries comes out to $10. For $10 I'd rather go to Four Peaks; or Five Guys (get 2 burgers) or In-n-Out (2 burgers + fries). Of course; you get more meat at Smashburger; but honestly 1 double double at In-n-Out or Five Guys and some fries split between two is enough for a meal. This place tastes really good; but it loses on value.  In fact; I had a B1G1 coupon; so I brought my lady along and she got a salad. There is no doubt she enjoyed the salad. However; neither of us thought it was a good value even at B1G1 (Remember when Chipotle had B1G1? That was a damn good value).  Unfortunately; if you're in the Tempe area you should go a little further to try to get a table at Four peaks. Better value and better food there. If you can't wait; hit up Five Guys on Mill or In-N-Out on 202/Rural.,0LYLGCIqNQQrpMwOxJ1hlrg,So; how much do you like hamburgers?  Do you like them enough to pay $8 for one?  Do you like them enough to willingly go near ASU?  If you're still nodding your head; chances are good that you'll like Smashburger.    As burger joints go; it's one of the nicer ones--clean; stylish decor; and friendly employees are big pluses here.  You will pay for those pluses though; when you find yourself forking over more than $10 for the prototypical burger; fries; and high fructose corn syrup drink of your choice.    What you'll get for that ten-spot is somewhat distinctive though.  Smashburger's claim to fame; of course; is the way that they seer the burger patty; thus getting it piping hot in a hurry.  What this means for you is that you'll be the proud owner of one of the messier burgers in America.  Grab plenty of napkins and plan to wear a shirt you don't mind getting greasy.    I suppose the fries are a love em'/hate 'em affair.  If you're a traditionalist; prepare to be annoyed:  Smashfries are doused in oil and herbs.  They make a nice taste; but get old pretty quickly and I've never been able to finish an order.  Though hardly cheap or perfect; I like Smashburger on occasion as it's a nice change from the usual fast food fare.,0LYLGCIqNQQrpMwOxJ1hlrg,It was a huge burger. Definitely yummy; but dripping with oil and heavily seasoned. But you cant help but feel like your arteries are clogging up as you keep eating. The place was incredibly busy. It was too expensive for what it was offering. There was no seating; so we ended up taking our food to go and eating outside on a bench. and parking sucks.,0LYLGCIqNQQrpMwOxJ1hlrg,Wow!  Let me start by saying I love a good juicy burger; it ranks as one of my favorite foods.  As simple as it sounds it is hard to find a great one so I usually make my own if the mood strikes.  After a disappointing experience at the new 5 Guys; I was a little hesitant to try Smashburger.   No worries; this burger is near perfect.  Full of flavor; great bun; nice toppings and you could tell the cook did not commit the cardinal sin of leaning on the burger during cooking and losing all the wonderful juice.  Fries were also good; thin and crispy.  Price was maybe just a tad high but you get what you pay for and I'll pay an extra dollar or two for the quality.  Only small complaint was it was just a little salty so if you don't like salt tell them to skip it.  Overall one of the best ever.,0LYLGCIqNQQrpMwOxJ1hlrg,I like Smashburger burgers. They use good meat and ingredients - not at all like the typical fast food. They can get soggy pretty quick - which isn't necessarily a bad thing. They are on the pricey side. The burgers justify it. It's the sides that are overpriced. I attached a photo of my milkshake to go. It out barely filled half the cup. And it wasn't a large cup. Just count on lunch being $10-15.,0LYLGCIqNQQrpMwOxJ1hlrg,Bleh.   I've tried this place twice now; once for a burger and once for the chicken. I'm not going to say that this place is outright terrible; because it's an edible burger; but aside from being new and still spotless; this place is inferior to it's nearest competitor (the Chuckbox) in almost every way: it costs quite a bit more; the burgers are good but nothing great; the chicken tasted quite good (but a tiny piece of meat on the bun for a $6 sandwich); the fries were garbage; there's no free parking; and it just has nothing special going for it.,0LYLGCIqNQQrpMwOxJ1hlrg,"Being a self proclaimed burger junkie; I have to weigh in on where Smashburger fits into the valley burger scene.  First off; if your litmus test for a good burger is price; you probably shouldn't be rating burger joints.  Remember people; the only reason you expect to pay next to nothing for a burger is because McDowell's has trained you to believe that a great burger is cheap!  Good food costs so stick to the fast food chains if you are looking for a $3.99 value meal.  Now; for those of us serious about our burgers; Smashburger is definitely a place to put on your list of must visits.  I have only visited the University location so other SB's may have bigger dining areas; but the University location is sorely lacking in space.  Between the hassle of parking and finding a seat; you would be well advised to go before or after the ASU lunch hour.  That being said; the burgers are worth it.  Not sure if I buy into the whole \smashing the patty on the grill\"" makes a big difference; but I will say that one taste will tell you that the ingredients are fresh and the meat is real beef - not a frozen pre made patty.  There aren't many choices for toppings but the presence of a fried egg option and jalepeno's should keep most burger lovers happy.  The fries are ok and include Sweet Potato options but the burger is the star here.  The shakes are good too but this is clearly where the profit is being generated.  Service is good but they could use another register during lunch hour as the line extends outside of the restaurant during lunch.  Other than that minor hassle; there isn't any reason that you can't get your Smash on too!""",0LYLGCIqNQQrpMwOxJ1hlrg,"Being a self proclaimed burger junkie; I have to weigh in on where Smashburger fits into the valley burger scene.

The first time I went i got a made to order burger adding lettuce; tomato; grilled onion; cheddar; smash sauce; pickle and bacon on a 1/3 pound burger and traditional bun. This was a good juicy burger with the bacon being pretty tasty. It was also pretty filling for it's size.  The next time i got the arizona burger which is a 1/3 pound burger; peper jack cheese(?); chipotle mayo; guacamole; lettuce; onion; jalepeno; and some spicy bun the type escapes me. The flavors worked well together and i was impressed that while a spicy flavor came through so did each individual element. Even with the jalepenos there wasn't a really fire or burn to overpower the burger but a nice heat. It was a good specialty burger but i would prefer grilled onions on it.  The thing that will keep me coming back however is that smashfries which are great and the rosemary and garlic taste is just a perfect balance. No ketchup needed here the flavors are enough themselves. I have had the fries at 5 Guys; Delux; Joe's farm grill and these may be my favorite.  Also a nice touch with the close location to ASU is that they do except sun dollars. For a price that falls between McDonalds and more gourmet burger places this is a winner for flavor and value. With other choices like Chuckbox; 5 Guys; Whataburger; and 4 Peaks in the area this still is the best.,LYLGCIqNQQrpMwOxJ1hlrg,I love; love; love this place. It's near campus; and I live close by so I do come here often. Manager is a great guy; greets everyone with a kind; professional word. Great for groups as well. Food is out of this world delicious! Smash fries are divine. However; err on the side of caution! Way greasy food; I mean- the grease drips off of the burgers and onto the paper. The shakes are fattening but that's the best kind; because they are delicious and made with real ice cream! I can not possibly recommend the milk shakes enough! They even have malts.  Some times this one is so crowded you wont get a seat; so please be prepared to face a completely loud and crowded restaurant. Also; depending on what you get; bit pricey; but you get what you pay for- high quality.,LYLGCIqNQQrpMwOxJ1hlrg,Found a free SIDE coupon; so had to try this place. The Arizona burger was really delicious. It was $5.99. And my hubs had the Arizona grilled chicken burger.   The sweet potato fries were fabulous. They're made with rosemary; olive oil and garlic. If you dine in; they do bring your food to your table which is a nice treat.   While I enjoyed this place; I still think In N Out is the best burger place. (And it's must cheaper too.),LYLGCIqNQQrpMwOxJ1hlrg,I tried Smashburger after hearing great things from a coworker.  The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the volume of ambient noise; It's very loud. The second was the prices on the menu.  I had a 1/3lb Spicy Baja burger; Smashfries; and a drink; coming to about $11.  The burger was very tasty; Not the best burger I've ever eaten; but rather enjoyable.  The fries didn't reach my expectations; they were very oily; and I ended up leaving half of them on the plate.  While the food was decent; it wasn't worth $10 to me.  I'll probably eat there again; but not soon or often.,LYLGCIqNQQrpMwOxJ1hlrg,This is more of a quick post than a full review as I only spent a few minutes in this place. I was next door at port of subs and decided to try the smashfries that I had heard so much about. As I walked in I was greeted by a friendly college age employee who was more than happy to answer any questions I had. I placed my order and sat back in one of their booths near the door and waited for my fries to be ready.   This location is really small and can get crowed fast as they are super close to ASU. I gave this place three stars because the cook staff took a really long time to make my order; and the fries were kind of oily.  While a little pricey I have decided to give them another shot as I hear they make a great burger. The next time I think I will try their location in Phoenix where hopefully it will not be as crowed.,ihMUU9D2mcgrp7fi8lmqJg,"Boo for Chick-fil-A closing the Ghettrocenter location; which was closer; but yea for this location for being so much closer than Arrowhead.  Come to think of it; this location was quicker and more efficient than Arrowhead; resulting in hotter; fresher food.  Yea for Deer Valley Chick-fil-A. My lunch hour drive thru order was ready before I was with the cash; meaning the chicken's precooked; but they still had to slap it together; since I got the lettuce and tomato.  All the food was fresh; nice generous portion of green leaf lettuce; good-as-can-be-expected tomato (2 slices); and the waffle fries were in the exact correct place on the delicate Greasy-Crispy Spectrum.  The two clerks I interacted with were friendly and it even seemed genuine.  Sure Chick-fil-A is not as cheap as other fast food choices; but it's so much better feeling the clear juice of a real chicken breast run down your hand than the mucky slippery oil from a chopped & formed chicken 'patty' that a lot of places have. (Exactly what part of the chicken is the 'patty'; anyway?)  Churchies own all their places; so they are oh so annoyingly closed on Sundays as a rule.  But the food is so good that any effort to protest them by not going the rest of the week would be short-lived.  Now if they ever started in-store proselytizing; that'd be a different story; but they've never done that; far as I can tell.  When I go in; I get the Ice Dream; exactly what part of the cow that is; I do not know; but it's sad to think they get those cows' hopes up by making them stooges for their \EAT MORE CHIKN\"" mock-protest marketing campaign; only to steal their dreams from them one way or another; and freeze them up for a tasty frozen dessert.  I picture a dark and gloomy torture room; probably the basement of one of their churches; where cows are strapped up and sucked of their dreams;  like the hapless folk from the Dark Crystal having their 'essence' drained by the Skeksies.  Or maybe that's how they get the fresh lemonade?""",ihMUU9D2mcgrp7fi8lmqJg,We love the family friendly atmosphere of Chik Fil A.

I love their local promotions like the \1-2-3 that's enough for me\"" where you received a free 3 piece chicken strip. Great management.  Love the calendar coupons too.  Would recommend buying one each year.  Great savings for sure.  I love the new grilled chicken salad.  It's a little pricey; but tastes great and is fresh.""",ihMUU9D2mcgrp7fi8lmqJg,I have been to at least 4 different Chick-fil-A's since i moved to Arizona and this location in Deer Valley is by far the best. First of all it is right across the street from where i work and they are always giving away free food...via your receipt or sending out discount coupons. They make the best chicken sandwich on earth...i am not kidding. It is the first real chicken breast sandwich i ever seen served at a fast food restaurant. It is a little more expensive than your average chicken sandwich but it is definitely worth it. It is not open on Sunday's because it is a Christian Franchise so they let their employee's have Sunday's off.   This particular location has great customer service...fast service...it is extremely clean and all the food is great no matter what you choose. The dessert is not half bad either...so if you ever want the best chicken sandwich you have ever had in your life please go to Chick-fil-A. Eat; Drink; and be Merry my friends!!!!,ihMUU9D2mcgrp7fi8lmqJg,Love chickafila :) they're pretty pricey for fast food though,ihMUU9D2mcgrp7fi8lmqJg,I really enjoy the food here. Probably one of the best layouts for a fast food but it feels more homey than any fast food. The service is very hands on; extremely well maintained facility; the best playroom ever and the food is great. If you watch your diet; the salads are great. I am willing to pay a higher price for food when the service and product is his good.,XmDiFI8SuougNUi02ZCdwA,Spent $50 for a family of 4. In & Out is just as good and under half the price.,XmDiFI8SuougNUi02ZCdwA,Don't get me wrong the bugers were great; perfectly cooked; Five Guys strawberry was good. But it wasn't mindblowing. Now I say the location in front of the flatiron building is more fun looking than being packed like sardines in a resturant. But it was still fun and the line was long but moved fast. Would recommend for a quick cheap bite. Fighting people for a seat will be neccasary; not impossiable.,XmDiFI8SuougNUi02ZCdwA,The burgers are...well okay.  The best?  Naw.  The fries are good; but are way too greasy!  I'm sorry but if the grease has soaked through a brown paper bag; that's just nasty!    The soda machine is awesome though!  I like the fact that I can make a custom soda just for me!  Five Guys is way too too expensive in my opinion.  $20+ for 2 combos.  But you do get a lot of food.  Is it worth the price?  Not really.    I'll go down the road to Pete's for a Monster Everything Burger; Fries (with special sauce) ; and a 32oz drink.,XmDiFI8SuougNUi02ZCdwA,The burgers are...well okay.  The best?  Naw.

On one hand; the fries are great; even if they are your sodium intake for the month. The burgers; on the other hand; are so-so. Not bad; mind you; and they are definitely fresh and custom made. They're just not that great. They remind me of something I would pull off of the grill in the backyard.   For the money; I'll just go to In-And-Out; save a few bucks; and get a better burger. Still; if you've never been; you should check them out at least once if for no other reason than the fries and awesome soda machine.,XmDiFI8SuougNUi02ZCdwA,I love me a good burger and 5 guys doesn't disappoint.  The burgers are ok for the price but the fries are a MUST order.  A regular order can feed 2-3 people because they don't skimp.  As a whole I would give this place 3 stars but they earned a 4th start for their online ordering system.  No waiting in line for this gal!,XmDiFI8SuougNUi02ZCdwA,A good; consistent burger.  Their fries are great!  Kinda pricey...,XmDiFI8SuougNUi02ZCdwA,Nearly 11 years ago or so; I was traveling through the midwest and there was a little hamburger joint in a run-down building that was near my hotel. Free peanuts and unlimited free toppings was unheard of back then and the burger and experience was memorable. A decade later; five guys just started popping up everywhere and it became famous; so I was back trying those burgers and fries again and hoping to recapture that grey day years ago in the midwest and have another great burger. I always like rooting for the little guy; but Five Guys is not little anymore; they have made it; so whether or not I root for them anymore doesn't matter a lick.    I ordered a Little Hamburger and fries and the meat is still fresh and the fries still have that skin on (although way oily) and the peanuts are still available. Stores all have that corporate look and feel; but these burgers are better than other fast food chains. It's not legendary; but not overpriced either at about 4 bucks for a 1/4 pound burger. Still; the best part of Five Guys is throwing your peanut shells anywhere and everywhere. Yep; it's the small things in life that make me happy.,XmDiFI8SuougNUi02ZCdwA,"Most people love their hamburgers but I am a fan of their hot dogs!  Their regular burger is pretty tasty and is a double patty. Their small burger is one patty and definitely enough for me.  I love the fact that you can put all kinds of toppings for no extra charge. It really gives you an opportunity to experiment with different toppings every time you go.   However; the pricing is a little on the expensive side for being hamburgers and hotdogs. Not too expensive....just like 10.00-12.00 for a \combo\"" as they sell things separately.  Overall; once in a while I crave it and do end up coming back.""",XmDiFI8SuougNUi02ZCdwA,"The Hype doesn't live up.   This is not the first Five Guys Ive enjoyed(there's one less than a mile from my house); but decided to review this one. I will start off by saying I enjoy 5 guys. I think they have a good tasting burger; fries; and hot dogs. I don't think they live up to the hype though...   I like that they give you the options of what you get on the burger in regards to condiments(onions; lettuce; jalapenos; etc)  (Which this isnt a new concept \having it your way\"" though)  Hotdogs cut down the middle to lay flat on a bun works well; but just doesnt seem the same (not sure why though)  My big complaint is the price. I think it is way too high for what it is. When a hamburger cost 5 plus bucks. Fries are close to $3. and the drinks are $2 Lunch gets expensive quick.   The other; when they wrap the burger or hot dog they seem to squish the burger and when you unwrap it; it looks like a linebacker wrapped the thing and its all squished together...

We had heard a few people rave about this place; and now I wonder if they were dropped as a baby or how they got this brain damage.  The \cheese\"" is this awful petroleum grease product with yellow color.  That was the worst of it; but nothing was good at all.  And crazy price to boot.""",XmDiFI8SuougNUi02ZCdwA,"This is an unfair review based on pricing and the menu.  More of a heads up.  I hear good things about this place; especially for a chain; so I decided to stop by for lunch.  Unfortunatly; I also decided to leave before I ordered.  Two reasons.  First is price.  A plain burger is $4.  With cheese and goodies you are running up towards $6; which doesn't include fries.  All in all you are looking at $10 - $12 for a \combo\"" meal which is something they don't offer.  I like to eat so I was looking for some sort of double but I didn't see one on the menu.  What I did see (second reason coming up...) is that they cook all meat WELL DONE.  If I'm going to spend that much for a burger and fries I would like to be able to order it how a burger should be cooked (which is meduim or medium rare if you didn't already know).  Recommend \""The Grind\"" or \""Delux\""; both a stones throw away; and both do burgers right.  For a burger and fries; either will run you about the same amount if you forgo the tea and get water.  Both are Local to boot.  There's my two cents.""",XmDiFI8SuougNUi02ZCdwA,"I am updating my review and taking Five Guys down to one star after my most recent visit. I found that they had raised prices yet again and had reduced portion sizes. Few things anger me more as a consumer than this double hit in the wallet. Burgers appear to be smaller but the fries are noticeably smaller. The cups they use to hold the fries are about one third smaller and the \extra\"" fries they toss in have been cut by half. For the burger; fries and drink I had; the bill was just under $18. I can go to a sports bar I like in Scottsdale and have a selection of sandwiches with plentiful fries; a bottomless soft drink and with tip get out of there for less than my Five Guys bill AND have someone serve it to me on a plate. Raise prices OR shrink portion but don't do both. This tactic offends me and my wallet and I doubt if I will be back.""",XmDiFI8SuougNUi02ZCdwA,Amazing Burgers... Bad Fries  I absolutely love the burgers here. Theyre very juicy; cooked just right and they have a wide aray of options for building your burger. Personally; I like putting the green chilli peppers on my burger. However; every time I order the overpriced fries her they always turn out soggy and greasy which is a big turn off for me. Although I often just order it to go and eat the burger at home with some chips or a side dish to complete the meal.   When you order you can expect to pay a pretty high price relative to other burger joints and the wait is longer than average.,JRFm4zOkJW2L0m4TsXBJ_w,Lets get the bad out of the way first; the prices.

The staff was staying busy and the restraunt is always spot on clean. The manager put on a show by being all over the place; he was very fast and extremely helpful not only to his staff but everyone in the store. I recommend this place to everyone.

I allegedly had a hot dog too; but it was obviously quite forgettable; because the only detail I really remember from the hot dog was explaining to the broad who took my order that \""everything on a hot dog *doesn't mean lettuce...\""  I'll go satisfy my appetite with something spectacular....... elsewhere.""",JRFm4zOkJW2L0m4TsXBJ_w,How in the world does this place not have at least 4 stars. I have yet to find a better tasting burger in the valley. Yes it's a little expensive $25 for two people; but it's great to go every once in a while. Every order is to-go. They give you a drink cup full of frys and drastically overflow your cup so that the whole bottom of the bag is basically frys. A little greasy; buy delicious if you like a little grease in your food. In-N-Out is walking distance from my house; but when I have a burger craving I always go to five guys.  Get Cajun seasoning on the frys Toppings are free Soooo many frys! :D Mmmm..  Go get a burger already!,JRFm4zOkJW2L0m4TsXBJ_w,Over priced and underwhelmed.

The manager must be deaf and all his help will be after working there for any length of time. You can hear the constant music and throbbing beat from the street. You might want to turn an assisted living accessories before entry just in case. My suggest: call in and have a brain dead overstrung ear budded young person go pick up your burgers. Yes the burgers are good. Bet the franchise would love to have the traffic In & Out has but they never will because the prices are to HIGH and the MUSIC is deafening.,JRFm4zOkJW2L0m4TsXBJ_w,The burgers and fries are good if you have an addiction to grease and salt. Also they are very expensive. When they first open and people got to experience five guys business continues to fall.,JRFm4zOkJW2L0m4TsXBJ_w,I'm so happy to have a Five Guys near us now. This is located in the plaza near Target; Jimmy John's; and the old Costco (now becoming a Winco). It is a classic Five Guys setup with peanut bags and all.  When we went; it was crowded but service was efficient. We sat in the back and enjoyed the music and watching people use the fancy new Coke machines. The burgers and fries were delicious and we enjoyed it very much.,Y_Y91oeUrIwYa18F8ey5NQ,Ambience: 5/5 (relaxing blue and white decor; always super clean; with quality tables and booths and televisions in the background; outdoor patio seating; it's a fast food burger chain; but it feels like a family diner; and that's a good thing)   Food: 5/5 (ignorant chaps from the west coast will tell you that In-N-Out Burger is the best burger joint in the world; they are dead wrong; Culvers's butter burgers are made from the freshest beef; grilled to perfection with that oh-so-tasty char-grilled edges and a slice of Wisconsin cheese; topped with a toasted bun with a pickle on top; a burger simply cannot get any better; the other thing they are famous for is genuine; made-fresh-daily creamy frozen custard that simply is unparalleled; do yourself a favor and drive there right now; order a double butter cheeseburger with ketchup and nothing else; substitute cheese curds for fries; upgrade your drink to a frozen custard banana shake; and enjoy the best meal you will ever eat at fast food joint)   Service: 5/5 (this is what fast food service should always be like; friendly staff who genuinely want you to enjoy your meal; efficient counter service in which they give you a number; cook your food fresh; made to order; and then bring it out to you; for fast food; Culver's has unparalleled service)   Value: 5/5 (a little more expensive than other fast food joints; but it's still reasonably priced and the food is so much better than the competition that you are more than getting your money's worth)   Verdict: there is no debate; Culver's is the best fast food restaurant in the country; they have the best burger (butter burger); the best side (cheese curds); the best dessert (frozen custard); and the best service; sorry to say it to all you In-N-Out fans; but Culver's owns In-N-Out in every category possible.,Y_Y91oeUrIwYa18F8ey5NQ,Ambience: 5/5 (relaxing blue and white decor; always super clean; with quality tables and booths and televisions in the background; outdoor patio seating; it's a fast food burger chain; but it feels like a family diner; and that's a good thing)   Food: 5/5 (ignorant chaps from the west coast will tell you that In-N-Out Burger is the best burger joint in the world; they are dead wrong; Culvers's butter burgers are made from the freshest beef; grilled to perfection with that oh-so-tasty char-grilled edges and a slice of Wisconsin cheese; topped with a toasted bun with a pickle on top; a burger simply cannot get any better; the other thing they are famous for is genuine; made-fresh-daily creamy frozen custard that simply is unparalleled; do yourself a favor and drive there right now; order a double butter cheeseburger with ketchup and nothing else; substitute cheese curds for fries; upgrade your drink to a frozen custard banana shake; and enjoy the best meal you will ever eat at fast food joint)   Service: 5/5 (this is what fast food service should always be like; friendly staff who genuinely want you to enjoy your meal; efficient counter service in which they give you a number; cook your food fresh; made to order; and then bring it out to you; for fast food; Culver's has unparalleled service)   Value: 5/5 (a little more expensive than other fast food joints; but it's still reasonably priced and the food is so much better than the competition that you are more than getting your money's worth)   Verdict: there is no debate; Culver's is the best fast food restaurant in the country; they have the best burger (butter burger); the best side (cheese curds); the best dessert (frozen custard); and the best service; sorry to say it to all you In-N-Out fans; but Culver's owns In-N-Out in every category possible.,Y_Y91oeUrIwYa18F8ey5NQ,So we've been hearing all sorts of buzz about Culver's.. the famous butter burger and frozen custard place from Wisconsin. So we piled in the car and headed out to Mesa. When we got there the place was packed.. we stood in line for 10 minutes before it was our turn. The service is very friendly and super helpful. We even ordered the flavor of the day; caramel cashew swirls and were told we could pick that up later so it didn't melt while we ate our dinner.. that was very cool!  Anyway; you place your order and they give you a number so they can bring it out to you when its ready.. another nice touch. Well after we got our food; butter burgers; fries and cheese curds we felt well; kind of let down. The burgers here are alright; kinda greasy and lacked a good beef flavor. The cheese curds were also deep fried (as most on the menu) and were good but not as good as I was hoping.   The crowd there.. it was like I was in Iowa or something.. definite Walmart crowd.. I sat there and watched this kid pick his nose and then proceed to fill his soda cup from the soft drink fountain.. uhm; yeah.. I just looked at my cup and thought about all the other people who touched that button.. suddenly didn't feel very good.   We got our frozen custards.. eh; very very smooth and creamy but to me just tasted like ordinary soft serve ice cream. Cashews were salty and nicely roasted; a good contrast to the smooth custard but lack depth and interest in the overall taste of the frozen custard.  I probably wouldn't ever go back here.. though the service is great and is priced well; I just don't think the food was worth the drive back out to Mesa.,Y_Y91oeUrIwYa18F8ey5NQ,Love the butterburgers and cheese curds here!! A must go for a good burger and very decently priced. Always made to order so you know its fresh. The bacon is cooked to perfection and makes a nice crunch. Just how I like it!! Had to sub the curds for the fries; but that's not a problem with a cheese loving kid like myself!!! Will be back for sure.,Y_Y91oeUrIwYa18F8ey5NQ,Custard is pretty good-but pricey for what you get-a la Cold Stone. Burgers are good-menu seems to be trying too hard to offer too many things to too many people. I like the cheese curds though-more places should have them. I'm told this is a midwestern chain; which explains some of it. The staff is almost eerily pleasant; and at first it was a little off-putting; but now I like it compared to the standard indifference you get at most places.,Y_Y91oeUrIwYa18F8ey5NQ,This is the best place we have found for breaded pork tenderloin sandwiches!  They are amazing!  Their custard is well worth the price!!  Just like homemade and so many options!  Get a frequent customer card and get free custard AND a free sandwich basket after so many stamps.  Great place!  Highly recommend!,Y_Y91oeUrIwYa18F8ey5NQ,You know; for a chain; this place is pretty amazing. My mom and I go here often when I take her grocery shopping. The staff is very friendly and super-helpful. I've had a couple of the burgers; and the pot roast. Who's ever heard of pot roast at a chain fast-food place? Culver's does it; and it's good! There are plenty of sides to choose from. The ice cream is actually frozen custard; and oh my goodness! They do a special flavor each day; vanilla; and chocolate; with various configurations and mix-ins available. Prices are reasonable. Worth it!!,Y_Y91oeUrIwYa18F8ey5NQ,This is an amazing place.  I have not had a chocolate malt as good as this since I was a kid.  We had to wait a little longer than usual (or so they thought) and brought us a coupon for our next visit.  Then we went back and we wanted to switch the coupon for something else; but they couldn't do it.  So we order malts again; just one.  We had to wait again and one of the boys came out and said we made an extra by mistake; do you want it?  Duh of course.  So we got two for the price of one.  Most excellent.  LOVE this place.,Y_Y91oeUrIwYa18F8ey5NQ,The way my Dad talked about this place I seriously expected them to give you free lapdances with each meal. He serviced them and said their kitchen was one of the cleanest fast food kitchens he'd ever seen and then went on to blab for hours about how their food couldn't compare to anything else and they were going to change the way Arizona sees fast food.  We came here as a family for dinner. The place was REALLY crowded and the line long. It's kind of hard to order because they make everything made to order (which is good I mean...yum fresh!) but that means you have to explain what you want in detail on every burger. When you're ordering for a family of five; that makes it kind of complicated. I thought their prices were a little high too but my dad insisted it was worth it.   The burgers were really good. I was a big fan. The fries were whatever; but my dad ordered fried cheese curds and those were really tasty. Everything came out pretty quick but we discovered that we had been charged for an extra meal. So we ended up taking home a meal we didn't order because the line was so long we didn't want to complain about it. My family ordered frozen custard but I'm lactose intolerant so I held out. They said it was great though.  I'd definitely come back here but not with my entire family. The ordering situation was just too intense and messy for me. If they're going to be as busy as they are; they should really have a better system.,Y_Y91oeUrIwYa18F8ey5NQ,I expected much more from this place.  I had heard exciting tales of succulent burgers cooked in yummy butter; and while I could definitely taste the butter; the rest was bland and poorly balanced.  Fries were ok; but they felt like a cheap Del Taco knock-off.  Service?  If you like a snotty heavy-set woman getting short with you; then it's great.  Culver's needs to hire some better folks; especially if they're trying to get their foot in the door here in Arizona.  They need employees who can think.  I had a coupon for a buy one get one free Double Deluxe; and they wouldn't substitute a cheaper burger for the free one.  Logic doesn't fly here; apparently.  Oh; and whoever designed the parking lot is an idiot.  What a horrible; cramped design.  If you drive a big truck or SUV; good luck to you.  I won't go back.,Y_Y91oeUrIwYa18F8ey5NQ,"If you've read some of my other reviews you'll see a trend.   Kohl's Department Stores.....Brewers spring training......   Yep; I'm a cheesehead. (But if you EVER actually catch me wearing a hunk of fake foam cheese on my head; shoot me. Really.)   What can I say? I like Culver's. It reminds me of home. It's total comfort food.   Got one of their Wisconsin Swiss melts. What other fast food joints offer burgers with Swiss on rye? The crinkle cut fries are always hot and fresh. And tasty.   Culver's is known for their frozen custard. What Wisconsinite has not driven past a Culver's; looked at their sign; checked out the 'flavor of the day'; and gone; \Hey; that sounds good!!\""; and quickly pulled into the parking lot?   If you're from Wisconsin or the Midwest stop in for a Butterburger and some custard....it will bring back lots of good memories.   Like another reviewer noted when he said he felt like he was in Iowa or something.....well.....that's the whole charm behind Culver's. You DO feel like you're in Wisconsin or one of the upper Midwest states.   Granted I'm not the best person to review Culver's....I'm a little biased towards it. But if you want a 'different' kind of fast food experience and you've never been to the upper Midwest; it's a heck of a whole lot cheaper than flying there.   Give it a chance....see if you like it.""",Y_Y91oeUrIwYa18F8ey5NQ,Hadn't been to Culver's in a couple of years; since I changed jobs and don't get out this way anymore. Nice to see they haven't changed. Frequented by seniors because it's a Midwest fave and for the good prices.   Ordered the bacon cheddar butter burger (single) with curds and a drink for under $8. Lunch arrived in 6 minutes flat-nice. Burger was hot; juicy and choice of standard toppings: mayo; mustard; onions; lettuce; tomato; etc.   Bacon was crisp too; just perfect. Cheese was thick cut with a slight melt. The cheese curds are not what you'd expect on your first visit. They bread them and fry them to perfection. Nice little cheesy nuggets of flavor.   The service at Culver's is always tops. Greeted properly at the door but not with the robotic 'welcome' you get at fast food. As the food is delivered to your table; the server always asks if there is anything else they can get for you. I was offered a custard sample at my table as well.   Culver's is a go-to for quality; service and price.,Y_Y91oeUrIwYa18F8ey5NQ,Stars are for the Custard/Ice Cream. Haven't tried anything else but holy smoke that custard is outrageous good. I don't even want to look at calories. If you're in the mood for anything ice cream; THIS is the place to get it. Prices are smoking good too. Great stuff.,Y_Y91oeUrIwYa18F8ey5NQ,A few years ago I discovered Culver's while visiting my sisters in Austin. I fell in love. When I learned they were building one within a 10 minute drive from my house; well; I can't describe the feeling. It's actually a good thing that they aren't closer or I'd probably weigh about 20 more pounds than I do.  Anyway; Culver's has perfected the hamburger. Who else but a midwestern fast food chain would come up with the concept to dredge their hamburgers in butter before cooking them? They aren't those frozen uniform-sized patties either. My personal fave is the Swiss Mushroom variety but they have lots of other options as well. I hear the salads are good too - I just like the burgers too much to order anything different.  And their frozen custard is truly food of the gods. If you've never had frozen custard; you are in for a treat. It's like ice cream; but even more creamy with a slightly firmer texture. I tend to lean towards the turtle sundae which is assembled to perfection - vanilla custard topped with caramel; fudge and pecans.  They also have some very creative flavors of the day; including cheri amour amaretto; turtle cheesecake; bananas foster; caramel cashew; chocolate covered strawberry; apple pie... the list goes on and on.  The best part is that the prices aren't but a tad higher than you'd pay a McDonald's. Our family of 4 (which includes 2 teenage boys) can usually dine there for about $30 including dessert.,Y_Y91oeUrIwYa18F8ey5NQ,Culvers is a great place! They have a large menu to please just about any one. I often suggest Culvers when I am trying to think of a place that will please almost any one. They have kids meals and old fashion dinners with items like pot roast and mashed potatoes. Culvers has nice salads also.The fries are not very good; better off with mashed potatoes; cheese curds or onion rings.  The custard is alway yummy; maybe a bit too sweet but good. The fruit freezes are good. Overall; a nice place to get a low cost meal.,Y_Y91oeUrIwYa18F8ey5NQ,The only thing bad I have to say about this place is that it is a bit pricey if you're not alone. Other than that the food is tasty; service is excellent; and it is hands down the best place to do a fundraiser. I love supporting my local teams and schools by eating here. They always have some sort of promotion going on. Its casual; but still nice. Its kept very clean. The menu has a nice selection and the food is always served hot. If you're looking for something fast that is more upscale than McDonald's; go here.,pQPIaCWok_yVzY-0JvfURQ,Sushi  was not too bad except for seaweed; not so good. However; happy hour menu is not much to offer  compare to other place. The price is kind of high for the size of a roll which is kind of small.,pQPIaCWok_yVzY-0JvfURQ,I'm a big fan of the food and drink offered here.  Lots of noodle and stir fry places put a lot of green/red peppers and bamboo shoots in the mix so they can skimp on the good stuff (meat and other veggies).  This place has a good balance of ingredients in all of the dishes I have tried.  My boyfriend commented that he really likes the noodles; he was sad to finish them off before he had eaten all the chicken in his curry.   The bar has a lot to offer but the prices are a little steep considering the happy hour specials other places in the area offer.  The food on the other hand is very reasonably priced with large portions.,pQPIaCWok_yVzY-0JvfURQ,My husband and I tried this place on a whim. For a Saturday night this place was hauntingly empty. We were seated right away and our server promptly took our drink orders. The prices for sushi are on the high side but I ordered a roll and two pieces of nigiri anyways. My husband ordered the garlic shrimp noodles.   We listened to a decent cover band while we waited for our food. But like I mentioned the place was empty so I felt kind of bad for them. When our food came we were less then impressed. For the price I expected much larger rolls and a better cut of salmon. My husbands dish was bland tasting and made even worse by the old hot sauce sitting on the table he used to add a kick to it.   The gist of the evening is we had semi ok service (we did wait forever for the bill) and really not ok food. We will probably not be back.,pQPIaCWok_yVzY-0JvfURQ,Mmmm. This is my favorite Asian cuisine! It is a small; independently owned business with a WONDERFUL menu; fairly priced; and friendly staff. They have the customer in mind :) I could eat here everyday. Good for happy hour drinks and appetizers,pQPIaCWok_yVzY-0JvfURQ,"Really small place with really good live jazz music; food & drinks. The food prices are low but drinks are a little high.  Make sure to check out their facebook page to find out when they have live music:  http://www.facebook.com/AsiaInMesa  Overall; this is my favorite place to go when I want a mellow night out with my hubby.  Looks like this restaurant is now just called \Asia\"" and has a separate yelp account for reviews:  http://www.yelp.com/biz/asia-mesa#query:asia""",pQPIaCWok_yVzY-0JvfURQ,Wow! This place is great! Great flavors; great portions; great prices. We found this place & ate there 3 times in 2 weeks; and we were out of town for 5 days during that time!,pQPIaCWok_yVzY-0JvfURQ,Excellent food. Got crab puffs (tasted like east coast style); spider roll; and drunken shrimp. Was more than enough for my husband and I. We didn't get any beer but they had an excellent craft selection. Fair price and great food with good service.,LSElCCmJQNJDpIEf77NVpA,I love this place; it's convenient; good tasting; and cheap compared to other fast food establishments in the area.   Fries are sliced right there; using whole potatoes!  Burgers are cooked to order.  I love the SPREAD and always ask for extra packets for my dipping sauce for the fries. It's a taste of mayo; ketchup; and relish - YUM!  Waiting is my biggest complaint; but what can you do?  The best thing is if you haven't been or don't know - check out there SECRET menu online! Too die for!,LSElCCmJQNJDpIEf77NVpA,Been there twice.  With all the hype you'd think it was out of this world.  I found the burger to be dry; small and overpriced.  Frys were overcooked and flavorless.  BLA.,LSElCCmJQNJDpIEf77NVpA,"My non yelp daughter (who I still need to get on board with becoming an avid yelper) and I go here all the time. We really love their fries. The burgers are probably my favorite for fast food. The service is always really fast and the food is hot and fresh. I hear there are \off menu\"" items that I am just starting to learn about which is fun. Prices are great. Only complaint is the parking lot was very poorly designed. Going through the drive through is a nightmare at times. I will say though; I was impressed that one time when there was a really long line then had someone outsite taking additional orders to get them going faster. That is really great service especially in this AZ heat!""",LSElCCmJQNJDpIEf77NVpA,Well this lived up to the hype. For about $4.00 you get a truly excellent burger. Although it was cooked well instead of medium it still retained it's juiciness.  I thought there was a little too much salt on the patty. Not so much I didn't still wolf it down. The fries were standard; not bad but not memorable.  While places like DuMont or Royale make better burgers; I've never had anything this good at this price point.,LSElCCmJQNJDpIEf77NVpA,This is one of the newer In and Out Burger locations and it sits on the corner of a big retail area near the county line. Overall; there is really no way to go wrong with In and Out. Every one of the locations offers the same thing.  The value is great which makes it popular with snowbirds. Five bucks for a single cheeseburger value meal is cheaper and better than McDonalds.  The place is crowded and every time I've been there service has been slow. But for me it is not really an inconvenience. People generally order a lot of food when they go there; like for an entire family; so the orders are large.   The bathrooms are extremely clean and from what I can tell the whole place is. Usually I eat outside under the umbrellas. Great place; great burger; definitely better than Five Guys.,LSElCCmJQNJDpIEf77NVpA,This is our favorite fast-food joint when we travel out West. The burgers are awesome and the prices are reasonable. Restaurants are always clean and many have outdoor seating.   Fries are skinny but good. Other fast-food restaurants have better fries; but these are still good.,LSElCCmJQNJDpIEf77NVpA,Is it worth all the hype?  No I would not make a 500 mile road-trip just to go but it's good.  The burgers and fries are made while you wait exactly as you want them.  The shakes are really good and the staff is really friendly and fast.  The prices are very reasonable and I would recommend it if you're in the area.,tYlwIZWPEQFvU9avTaIv3w,Inexpensive sandwiches freshly prepared for you. The options are pretty basic; with your standard meats such as turkey and roast beef; with all the toppings you'd normally find in a sandwich (e.g.; Onions; lettuce; tomato). They do have a nicely piquant spicy pepper topping; which packs a punch! Like others have mentioned; it's kind of like a step up from Jimmy John's; in that the ingredients are better; with bigger portions; but it's not a sandwich I'll necessarily crave.  One plus here is that they sell Zapp's chips; for those that want kettle cooked spicy goodness!,tYlwIZWPEQFvU9avTaIv3w,"Visited Potbelly on a Saturday around 12:30PM. Skip to the last paragraph for the short and sweet review.  I've seen this place a few times and finally had a good opportunity to stop in and grab a to-go order.  I like the name and figured it would be average (worst case); but hopefully I would be surprised. This location shares a building space with Starbucks.   Although parking is a bit limited I found a space straight away. I found the decor warm and inviting.  It smelled of toasted bread; a plus in my opinion. After a short wait for two people ahead of me a very pleasant and friendly person; Ann I believe; took my order. I ordered a tuna salad sub on multigrain bread as well as one of their signature sandwiches called \A Wreck\"" on their white bread.   I also substituted cheddar cheese on the wreck and no cheese on the tuna salad.  They toast their sandwiches; so into the toaster they went.  When they come out the other side you can ask to add your choice of condiments. I asked for lettuce; tomato and onion on both; with some Italian seasoning on the Wreck.  I added some Zipps kettle chips (delicious chips made in Louisiana) and a sugar cookie. My bill came to a total of $13 and change.  Most of the sandwich options are around $5. I was in and out in under 10 minutes. Arriving home I tried half of each sandwich along with the BBQ Zipps chips and found everything to be pretty good.  The bread toasted up nicely; leaving a crusty exterior.  Based on the price; I felt the sub had adequate amounts of ingredients.  There were options on the menu for extra meat and the like.  The sandwiches themselves were around 7 inches.  Although it was not mind blowing or life altering...I mean; it's a sandwich shop for Pete's sake!  The place was nice; clean and had a pleasant and friendly staff.  Service was quick and efficient.  The food was good.  Would I go back again? Yes.""",tYlwIZWPEQFvU9avTaIv3w,Super good!  Great sandwiches; friendly and helpful staff; and fast service without skimping on quality.  Also; very reasonably priced.  I will be going back to this sandwich place.,tYlwIZWPEQFvU9avTaIv3w,This Potbelly location was clean; the service was great; and parking was tight. The sandwiches were OK - nothing spectacular. I think Quiznos is better. The prices were average - about $8.00 with tax for a sandwich and chips. Be sure to ask for mayo; mustard or oil; otherwise the sandwich will be dry.,tYlwIZWPEQFvU9avTaIv3w,A step above Jimmy Johns and 2x as good as Subway  The Wreck with everything is my Go-To order but their other options like the Pizza Sub is pretty decent as well.  Only wish is that they were a bit cheaper or offered a bigger portion,tYlwIZWPEQFvU9avTaIv3w,"Who copied who? Did Quizno come before Potbelly - these two chains are exactly the same; lousy. Potbelly says they slice their sandwiches fresh; but the dude (who annoyingly called me and every other guy \Boss') did not slice anything. He might have sliced it a week ago and then he just grabbed it and put in my sandwich. To top it off; the turkey is another low quality variety that is suitable for cow feed. Yeah; that's why the prices are so cheap - it was five bucks for the food and the turkey quality was masked because it looks like a wrap with alot of bread and toppings jammed inside. This is one time I was glad there wasn't alot of meat in my sandwich. College kids and construction workers will like this crap; but you ain't fooling the rest of the smart eaters in America; well maybe you are because of your snappy name and grand openings that require a PR agent; but never again for this guy.

It's a sandwich. It's under $10. What is there to complain about? Beats the hell out of a Subway.

Beats the hell out of a Subway. Blarg.,tYlwIZWPEQFvU9avTaIv3w,Wow! I am wondering if we even went to the same place??! I have been here 2 times; each time was amazing. There are a lot of people working there yes; but I assume since they just opened they are training as many people as they can before ASU opens. The sandwiches are priced amazing $5 for a toasted sub. The bread is a chibaata hybrid that is chewy yet soft. The milkshakes are some of the best shakes I have ever had; hand scooped and the little cookies they put on top are a perfect combination. Speaking of cookies; the oatmeal chip cookies are soooo good! Come here for good sandwiches; amazeaballs shakes; and freshly baked cookies. You can't beat the prices!!!!,tYlwIZWPEQFvU9avTaIv3w,"I had been waiting for this location to open for awhile to give it a try; including stopping several times before they were open thinking they were.  It seems like I got a bit ahead of myself on how good this might actually be. This isn't the super sandwich shop I was hoping for. It's more the Quiznos to Jimmy John's Subway. The comparison between JJ's and Potbelly is accurate as I feel they both want to present themselves as a more gourmet option to the Subway's and Silver Mines of the world; but really a just a new option on about the same level.  I had the italian sandwich here and while the meats are pretty tasty I didn't think there was much on their and it seemed greasy. The greasy feel was compounded by the fact that when I passed on mayo and mustard and opted for oil I got a sub drenched in it. I think with less oil the flavors of the meats would have come out more. I think the size of the sandwich was rather small as it was comparable in length to a Subway 6\ just wider and more bread. I do have to say the bread was quite good.  I am willing to go back and give potbelly a second chance as the price was reasonable enough that it is worth another shot. Maybe something else will be a more favorable sub.""",tYlwIZWPEQFvU9avTaIv3w,"Potbelly's are popping up more and more around the valley so I was destined to stop into one eventually  Today was the day! The girls that work at this location are all so very nice and helpful  The decor is cute and very historical; a ton of it consists of ASU/Tempe/Phoenix information and landmarks... Fun to read or look and eat...  The signs make it easy to navigate where to start your order and so forth... The huge menu on the wall is very clear and thorough... The sandwich options are pretty extensive  Today I went for \The Wreck\"" and I dressed it with pretty much every topping except mustard... It consisted of Ham; Roast Beef; Salami; Turkey; and Swiss cheese! Also the sandwich was toasted; not sure if that is how each one is prepared but it was good and I didn't mind :) I had my sanny with jalapeo chips and it was a very good lunch... Glad I stopped in and I will return I agree with everyone in saying that it is a better sandwich option compared to subway and Jimmy johns... Decent price too""",eZyqa81qS0LuH0Bv8vfvrw,I love In-N-Out. I am so happy to have one close by once again. The food is always good and the workers are always pleasant to deal with. I have never run into a rude employee. This location lives up to those high standards. Even when it is busy; which is most of the time; they get you through the line quickly. The food is fresh and delicious. I will always choose In-N-Out over other fast food places because the quality is much better for the same price or even less.,eZyqa81qS0LuH0Bv8vfvrw,"Yo......  I love In N Out.  I think they are the most consistent place out there; they are inexpensive; fresh and tasty.  That applies for most of them.....this is only the 2nd time out of probably 100s of times that I have been to an In N Out and was not completely impressed.  I placed my usual order of a Double Double with no tomato; both kinds of onions; and an order of fries.  Had a water to drink.  A little over $5.50.  Service was friendly but the food was \off\"".  My burger was not piping hot....the patties were warm but not hot.  The spread was also \""off\"".  I could taste a huge hint of mayo in the spread.  I know its made with mayo but they usually blend/cut that shit so well with the ketchup and relish; you never even get a hint of mayo taste.  I had more than a few bites with straight mayo taste.  It was not good at all.  The produce seemed a little off too.  The onions had a weird \""bite\"" to them.  Besides the Goleta In N Out; this was the worst In N Out Burger that I have had.  The fries were pretty good as usual.  Nothing wrong there.  I'm pretty sure I will not come back to this particular one.  The only reason I came here was that it was the closest In N Out to where I was at the time.  Ill drive a few miles up the road and hit up a different one next time.""",eZyqa81qS0LuH0Bv8vfvrw,I've been a consistent costumer of In N Out throughout the years. They make the best hamburgers EVER. Seriously; I feel like angels are dancing on my tongue after ever bite. I'm almost positive I saw a unicorn poop out a rainbow last time I was here. The food is always delicious; hot and fresh. This location was no different. Only downside to my last visit is that some rando crazy man walked in talking to himself and hung out in the corner for awhile having a very important  and loud conversation with himself. I wasn't really fazed. I mean shit it's 105 outside; that'll make the best of us go a little crazy. Now get up and go get yourself a damn double double and don't forget to animal style that ish.,eZyqa81qS0LuH0Bv8vfvrw,While this wasn't my first In-n-Out experience; it was my first in a over a decade and I have to say; I remember it a lot better than it actually is.  OK; don't get worked up. It just didn't thrill me.  It was fresh; well made and just fine.  I just don't want to build a temple in the building and worship it like others seem to!    I got a double double with onion (and when they mean with onion; they mean it!); fries and a chocolate shake.  I liked the burger (could have done without the special sauce; which to me is just thousand island); liked the fries; although they needed more salt and loved the shake (perfect consistency and chocolatey taste).   The place was packed; the service was fine and the price was right!  I would go go back; but I like Five Guys better - sorry I do!!,eZyqa81qS0LuH0Bv8vfvrw,"Why are these so popular again???  Just went to one for the second time in my life; and was reminded why it is not a \must go\"" for me.  Just an extremely average burger and fries; only the burger is smaller; and the prices are the same.....was over $7 for me to eat a maybe 3\"" diam Burger meal.""",eZyqa81qS0LuH0Bv8vfvrw,This was a treat for me because we don't have In N Out on the east coast. But the burger and fries were so delicious and the staff was so patient and friendly!! Cheaper than Five Guys and healthier! I highly recommend the double patty wrapped in lettuce.,eZyqa81qS0LuH0Bv8vfvrw,I had never visited an In & Out Burger restaurant and wanted to know what all the hype was about.  So last night; my husband and I decided to try it.  My impression was it is a very clean restaurant with a whole lot of employees who seem to be incapable of performing their job easily or well.  There were so many people behind that counter; most of them just walking around or partnering with another employee.  It was almost overwhelming to see so many workers crammed into that kitchen.    The burger itself was okay; nothing special IMO.  I thought the bun was nice.  I asked for the burger itself to be cooked well; no pink.  Well; it wasn't.  It arrived medium well.  The special requests I made were followed except for the cooking temperature.  No fast food burger should be served pink unless requested.  Blech.  The fries that I have heard folks rave about were just awful for me.  Mine were served room temperature; barely warm.  Greasy; flavorless; and soggy.  Yuk and double yuk.    My granddaughter ordered a strawberry shake.  Something happened to the shake machine and they had a terrible time making that little cup of ice cream and milk for her.  When it was finally served; there was way too much strawberry sauce in the drink.  It was horrid.    I won't go back again because the food was not impressive and neither was the service; despite the many many people working.  The prices were very fair.,eZyqa81qS0LuH0Bv8vfvrw,I don't even eat red meat and I have to give it 5 stars!  Love their grilled cheese with onions; fries; and either a strawberry shake or iced tea.  Low prices; fresh food; and friendly employees.  My favorite fast food place!  Parking lot can be a bit challenging and always crowded.   There is another location at the 101 and Camelback that isn't too far away; but not nearly as crowded.,eZyqa81qS0LuH0Bv8vfvrw,It's a good burger and milkshake-great for the price.  I am not a big fan of their fries; but I know a lot of people who are.  The hidden menu is fun to try out as well!  This place is always busy; but they have a good staff that speeds up the line quickly.,m3EKlucZuwnOazLrRfnWaQ,"So many different opinions; you just have to try for yourself. Me... If I'm in the area; it's Al's. Every time.  The Italian Beef is very; very good. No Chicagoans; It's not Portillo's. It's not supposed to be. It's Al's! So to all of us who hail from the windy city; let's all hold hands and make peace with the fact that Al's isn't Portillo's. That's why the sign above the door say's \Al's\"". Now shut up about it!  I ate at Portillo's three or four times a week when I was back home; and I'm looking forward to them being here too. But I'm just as happy to have Al's. This place is great!  The Polish is very good. Hot Dogs are great; The Combo was sooo sloppy good I was in heaven. The Italian Beef was awesome! Love the dipped option; sweet & hot with provolone. Sooooo damn good I'm getting hungry just thinking about it now!  Fries are just like Nanna's Hot Dogs on Irving Park; what I grew up with. Sooooo good! And to J.P. from Chandler.... All of the hot dog places I grew up with in Chicago always did and still do wrap your fries and dog together in paper. It's authentic; so enjoy the experience.  Folks; it comes to this. Al's does it their own way; so quit comparing it to every other place. They don't need to be anyone else! This place is great; a Chicago Institution that has stood the test of time; and worth the price tag. Especially if you're a wayward Chicagoan longing for the flavor's and feel of the windy city.   Walk into Al's; and you're home. Even if just for a little while. Mangiare!""",m3EKlucZuwnOazLrRfnWaQ,The food and service is good; but what ruins this place is its high price and lack of authenticity.  Nothing about this franchise location reminds me of Al's #1 Italian Beef in Chicago.  It's a good Italian beef; just not what I think of when I think of Al's.  The beef is good quality and delicious; but it's just missing the correct flavor that you get in Chicago.  The giardiniera (hot peppers) are perfectly spicy and the sweet peppers offer a wonderful additional flavor to the sandwich.  I paid $8.00 for a regular sandwich (with tax).  Not expensive for Italian Beef; especially since it was quite filling; but it still felt a little steep considering it would be at least another $3 or $4 for fries and a drink.  I think the biggest problem with this location is space.  The dining room is huge; although there really aren't that many tables.  The middle is wide open as if there's going to be a massive lunch rush.  However; at 12:30 on a Monday afternoon; the place was dead.  I haven't been to the real Al's since I was a kid; but I remember it as being a little dive.  It would've been a lot smarter for Al's to be in a much smaller spot; maybe they could charge less for their beef if they didn't have to pay so much for their square-footage.  Unfortunately for Al's; there's already a few Chicago hotdog/Italian beef joints in the Raintree area.  Name recognition to Chicagoans is the best thing Al's has going for it.  But; that's what has me the most disappointed because my expectations were way too high going in.  **TIP** If you're not from Chicago; order your sandwich dipped.  This means dunked in au jus after its assembled.  It's messy but wonderful.

Also got a side of chili-chese fries.  The place was big and clean; and of course; had the classic \Welcome to Chicago\"" slogan on the front door.  I couldn't imagine it any other way.  The sandwich was literally the best I have had.  The bread was soaked but still held up as I chomped it.  The peppers were finely chopped and gave it a great flavor that I cannot compare it too.  The only thing that prevented me from giving this place 5 stars was the huge Pepsi machine they had...  I think too for the price; you get a great deal.

Plus; you can get booze here if you like.  They also have TV screens in here; and at the time; they had on some football games; which was nice.  It's a nice place because I feel like its relaxed enough to enjoy a nice meal with a friend here; yet not to barish or uptight that you can't relax and have a decent meal.  Plus; the prices are great too!  What a great way to spend a saturday afternon.  I would gladly return to this place...prices are awesome; food is great; and the place is not typical pretentious Scottsdale!  wooohoooo!,m3EKlucZuwnOazLrRfnWaQ,I'm not a fan of roast beef or its many derivative dishes; but from what I see this is the place to get one. Personally I stick to the Chicago dogs and polish sausages and dang they are good and at a good price.  My only beef (har!) is that they aren't a TRUE chicago dog; as they are missing the cucumber and tomato; but regardless still a tasty dog at a great price!,m3EKlucZuwnOazLrRfnWaQ,"I'm originally from Chicago  and never go back without visiting Portillos at least once.  I am 5'3\ 115 lbs. and my order is a beef sandwich; extra gravy; sweet and hot peppers; an oder of onion rings; a \""Chicago\"" style hot dog; a  tamale and chopped salad.  Oh; and a diet Coke because I'm watching my weight :-)  My brother told me about Al's and thought the beef sandwiches were comparable to Portillos.  Since I didn't have my entire Chicago family with me to help eat my meal; I stuck with the beef sandwich (with hot and sweet peppers and dipped); the tamale and had to go with their french fries because they didn't have onion rings.   The beef sandwich was okay; but wasn't as good as Portillos.  I guess my main complaint would be the giardineria.  While they say the giardineria is freshly made; I've had better from a jar.  Although it was spicy; the taste was a bit off.  The fries.  According to the menu; they are freshly cut and made each day.  They need to send somebody over to In-N-Out Burger to see how its properly done.  They were not that good.   The tamale.  People born and raised in AZ may not appreciate these types of tamales; but they are what I grew up on.  Al's tamale came in a plastic wrapper (are these picked up from Costco in boxes of 24?) and are nuked.  I guess in the day they were steamed; but with the introduction of the microwave; that's how they are cooked today.  Unfortunately; mine may have been in the microwave a couple seconds too long.  Still edible; but pretty dry.  And it does lose something when it comes in that plastic wrap.  I didn't have a chance to check out their hot dogs or chopped salad.  I wouldn't go out of my way to go back there again (which I did today); but if I were in the area; I would go back and try the dog and chopped salad.  Luke's is being opened down the street from my home; so I'll have to do a comparison.  In the years I have been in Arizona I have yet to be impressed by any establishment claiming that something is \""Chicago\"" style.  I'm not quite sure why it's so difficult.  Portillos does have two stores in the Los Angeles suburbs - when I have a hankering; I am just going to have to hop in the car and take a road trip  for lunch!""",m3EKlucZuwnOazLrRfnWaQ,My impression of the New Al's.....  I was thrilled to see Al's was open again and stopped for a hot dog.... I knew exactly what I wanted but glanced at the menu to make sure it was the same and my eyes popped out of head!!!  OMG.....the prices have JUMPED!   I asked if the hot dog was bigger than it used to be..thinking that would be at least a reason for the price hike...one person said yes...the other owner? said no....  Turns out the hot dog was the same size...still a good hot dog...but I was not happy paying about $1.50 more for the same size hot dog.  Let's get to the fries...which I have always enjoyed as they remind me of the hot dog joynt I grew up going to in Chicago....the fries were o.k....but there was sooooo much salt on them and so many old looking fries I just couldnt eat them.  I am sure I will be back to try the beef...only because Lukes SUCKS....  Unfortunately now that Al's is charging as much as Lukes...their beef will  have to be pretty darn good to keep me as a customer.  Overall....very dissapointed....  Note to the owners...... You really need to have above average food to compensate for your price hike if you want to not end up closing down again.  Just because we are in Scottsdale doesnt mean we are willing to throw away money on bad food!,m3EKlucZuwnOazLrRfnWaQ,"Time for another review...my first visit to the NEW Al's wasent so great.....but in my review I did say I would be back to try the beef.

I stopped by at 11am ...(my thinking is everything will be fresh)...and I did order a regular size beef and small fry....  I was still not thrilled that it cost over $10.00 for a beef and small fry...however... I dont mind paying more if I feel its worth it...and in this girls opinion....the beef was TERRIFIC!  I did order the beef wet...with au jus and their homemade peppers on the side.  The beef (as previously reviewed by someone else) was dry and a bit bland...however...once I poured the au jus and peppers over it.....BAM!!!!  The flavors EXPLODED!    The sandwich was ample and two of us shared it and we were both very satisfied.  I like a beef sandwich that is NOT thick pieces of beef...and this was exactly that...  Lots of beef and the bread was nicely saturated in the yummy juices....  When I was in the restaurant I had the pleasure of speaking to Michelle...one of the owners  who was very interested in my opinion....so much so that she asked me to call her and let her know what I think...  I did just that....so Michelle....this review is for you....and for all of you Chicagoians out there who enjoy a really hefty and flavorful Italian beef.  If you went to Al's once....my suggestion is.....give it another try and order something different to get the true experience.  I will DEFINATELY be back for the Beef     I realize food is really  personal preference....  Some think Lukes is good....to me Lukes is BAD food at EXTREMELY high prices...I tried it once and wont ever go back....so bad I went against my rule of always trying a restaurant  at least twice...just to make sure....

All the while 50's - classic rock tunes are playing over the speaker system. As far as fast food chains go this is one of the better ones. Nothing like feeling a touch of nostalgia of a drive-in joint where you can sit in your car with the windows open in beautiful weather and have the food brought to you.   Happy hour from 2-4 where all the drinks are half price! Can't beat a Big Gulp sized Grape Slushie and Blue Coconut Slushie for only $1 each! Along with some tastily seasoned popcorn chicken; a ranch chicken wrap; and perfectly crispy tater tots this was a winning quick lunch!  Yum - tater tots!  Seems so seemless here. Pull up; press the red button; place your order; and within minutes it is brought to your car with a smile. If you want to eat outside there are some tables and chairs on a small patio in the front.

See if I go back to this Sonic ever again.""",po5FyERB4lUZNnBIwnhFlg,"During my time living in Maryland I've seen a good deal of Sonic commercials on the tele.  Being that I have never seen a Sonic; I was perplexed by these commercials.  So; using the power of the internets I discovered that there weren't any Sonics in the state of Maryland.  When I moved to my new home of San Diego; I was confronted by the Sonic commercials yet again.  I internet-searched again and found the nearest Sonic was about 2 hours away.  My perplexion flexed into downright dismay.  Commercials are expensive endeavors--so why would a company essentially throw their money away by advertising whereever they are not located?  One night; my friend Jen picked me up at the Phoenix Airport for a nice hangout weekend.  We were both really hungry and deciding where to nosh.  When out of the corner of my right eye i spy a garish forty-one hundred kelvin fluorescent beacon in the night.  I thought it was some sort of carwash or super-sized gasstation at first glance.  Jen explained that was a Sonic.  \What the fvck's a Sonic?\"" I replied.  To this point I have never seen a Soinic before in the flesh or in the disgusting eyesore of a prefab materials and light; as it were.  So it was decided right then and there that we would eat this Sonic.  Now; I know I cannot speak for all the distant Sonics in parts of the world a young hooligan such as myself has never been to; but to this; my virgin Sonicage; I can.  There is a huge slab of concrete which seemed way too large for the size of the building.  On this slab was lots of parking spots under a handfull of overhangs shining enough fluorescent light to make a operating room mildly jealous. Beside each of the parking spots was a lit-up menu with fast-food type stuffs; drinks; slushies; smoothies; ice cream sundaes; banana splits; etc.  As if this wasn't enough; they also have a drive-thru.  Again my perplexion returned.  The awful shine of it all; the harshness on weary eyes... It is a monument to decadence to the point of bloatation and bloatiosity.  While we were deciding what we wanted a Mexican family rolled up beside us with a roller-skated jalopy and young children in the back.  They ordered and pulled away blasting some thuggish gangsta rap as their trunk buzzed with whorish flapping sheetmetal not sealed or sealed or sealed.  Jen ordered blackberry iced tea and some fried mac n' cheese bites; I; the tater-tots with cheese and a cranberry limeade. We pulled away blasting while our thuggish gangsta rap as our trunk rattled and flapped whoreishly--waves dissipating into the must of chaparral; waves lifting into the witheringchaped desert night.  Got home and ate in normal lighting--Lighting that didn't make one's flesh crawl rutty-riddled with hungover insomniacian interrogation prior to a privilege afforded to be actually hungover.  The drinks were surprisingly not overly sweet and made with lots of that pellet style-ice that we so heart in drinks like these.  The iced tea was quality and the crisp tartness of my cranberry limeade (with actual half of a real lime floating in it) was perfectly refreshing.  The mac n' cheese thingees tasted like a crispy fried stouffers mac n' cheese.  Sadly; these are a limited time only option. As for my tater-tots with cheese; eh; not so good.  They were just bland cafeteria-style tots with a slice of American cheese thrown ontop--A wrinkly transparent orangish shellac coalescing my tots into a gelatinous choir.  ...and that was and is how I met a Sonic.""",po5FyERB4lUZNnBIwnhFlg,Would love to give more stars but what a cheapass place.

Try to limit my visits to once a month because they are just so darn good. Fresh! I have never gotten bad food here. I have always had friendly; fast efficient service. The prices are right; the food is fresh non nonsense straight forward good. I know there's probably 5000 calories in the meal; but plan for the occasion and splurge once in awhile. It's better than McDonalds with a bunch of frozen chemicals.,X6mWr96ibKdXQSA6mpH90g,now i know why everyone i know from the west coast cries a little when they find out there aren't any in-n-out burgers on the east coast. the burgers here are fresh and made to order. prices are unbeatable. definitely ask for spread to dip your fries in!!,X6mWr96ibKdXQSA6mpH90g,Oh; In-N-Out; I curse you and thank you at the same time for not being on the East Coast.  Curses because I crave you but can't have you.  Thank you because being to close would be too tempting.  I'd have to dig the fat clothes out of the back of my closet.    I love that you have stuck to your family roots and not sold out to Wall Street.  I love that you manage to keep normally apathetic teenager employees happy and enthusiastic.  I love that you give me an In-N-Out sticker for free.    I love your fresh ingredients.  And that you stood the test of time and didn't get all crazy with gourmet burgers or bloated menus.  You didn't decide to truck in your burgers frozen from the burger factory.  You stuck to what works; you didn''t mess with a good thing.  And you managed to keep it fresh without raising the price.    I also love that your fries aren't that great.  I do love that a teenager cuts the potato right there in the store; but unfortunately they're not to my taste.  That  doesn't stop me from eating your fries; of course. But eating less of them means i can have a second burger.  I especially love that.,X6mWr96ibKdXQSA6mpH90g,"How does In N Out do it?  The consistency is amazing.  The service is impeccable.

Going to In N Out is a \trip\""; it's always busy; so it's not like a quickie run for a burger and fry.

They never freeze their meat; so they're only located near their suppliers; which means that unless you're in California; Arizona; Nevada and even Utah; you can't get In-N-Out.  The secret menu I never figured out past asking for my burger \animal style\""; because I pretty much stopped at what I thought was awesome.  This particular franchise is located near a heavily trafficked shopping area north of Phoenix proper; and it is staffed by some very friendly and attentive people. It was clean; it was well kept; and the food was as I expected from my many visits to In-N-Out in California- tasty burger; fresh-cut and slightly greasy fries and cold beverages.  I like the burgers better at Five Guys; but In-N-Out has a charm and a superior level of service that makes it a pleasant place to dine. Someone actually hired the employees here for their customer service skills and not because they were the cheapest help they could find. That is a reason to patronize this location; right there.

BUT.... sometimes the fast route is in order. Recently; we popped through the drive through at 10p for one of those \teenager is starving and we ate dinner 3  hours ago\"" moments.  This happens frequently- we go to pick up one of our kids from some event and they are \""starving\"".  My kitchen's done-closed for the night; and they luck out by getting a half-way decent drive thru burger.

Yes they are fresh cut potatoes but if you've ever made really good fries; you should really soak you spuds in ice water for a while to bring down the starch so that they fry up crisper.  But- the fries are OK.  Here's the \""5 star\"" part:    Accurate orders- my kids order a hundred different variations; and they always get the order right.  Grilled onions- not commonly available via drive-thru  Their \""protein style\"" is a lifesaver if you avoiding bread.  This is the burger wrapped in lettuce; BTW.

I say \""attempted\"" because; for the first time in my life; I didn't make it past the drive-thru speaker.   While ordering; the lady taking my order began speaking with another employee about prices. About 15 seconds of this went on before she returned to speaking with me.   Having just waited for her to have a conversation that could've waited the 15 seconds it would have taken me to place my order; she begins speaking to me in a rushed manner. \""Do you want your combo 'this style; this style; or this style'?

All of the Chipotle's that I have eaten at have been very good; except for one in downtown Washington DC where a group of kids ran through the dining room chased by police officers.  They trashed the place; and spilled a perfume display that one of the kids was trying to sell.  Which may have been why the police were chasing them I don't know.  What I do know is the perfume smelled terrible.  Anyway back to Chandler.  The good thing about Chipotle is the menu.  It is very simple.  Basically you walk up to the counter and tell the nice person what you want to eat.  All the food is displayed in front of you.  You can mix and match it any way you like.  Tacos; burritos;   even melted cheese things that aren't on the menu but kids seem to love them.    There are a few different kinds of meat.  Carnetias or braised pork; grilled chicken; and two different kinds of beef.  One grilled the other BBQed.  Fresh green peppers and onions lightly seasoned and sauteed but still crispy.  Two kinds of beans; pinto and black.  The servers are quick to tell you that the pinto beans are not for strict vegetarians or the kosher crowd.    Rice seasoned with a little cilantro that is very tasty; and last but not least delicious guacamole.  As your meal (usually a burrito for me) is assembled it moves down the counter to the salsa section.  There are a few different kinds of salsa.  A spicy red one; I don't know what is in it but it is my favorite.  A tomato; onion; cilantro mild one.  Corn relish that goes in my burrito too; and a green one that I never tired.  Then some sour cream and cheese and they magically roll it and wrap it in a tin foil sleeve.    With really good food places it is the little things that can make or break them.  For example sour cream.  Pretty basic stuff right.  At Chipolte it is delectable.  I can't find sour cream near as good at any grocery store.  The tortillas are big and seem to stretch enough to wrap whatever they put in the burrito.  Did I mention that these burritos are really big?  If you don't want to go the tortilla route they will make your burrito in a bowl.  Same stuff just no tortilla.  I once ate at the Chipolte in Lawrence Kansas with a friend.  She ate two burritos.  She is a freak; don't try it you may explode.    They seem to be proud of their chips.  Most places offer them free of charge.  Chipolte charges for them.  They could be good I've never had them; but lot's of folks order them.      No doubt about it this is fast food.  I stopped by last Tuesday at noon.  Just before I walked in 14 giggling high school kids ran up in front of me.  The line was to the door.  Ten minutes later I was at the counter watching my burrito grow.  Amazing.  Just because it is fast food doesn't mean it has to taste bland or be cold.     This place is not cheap.  Eight and a half bucks for a burrito and a small drink.  I'll keep looking for a better burrito.  Till I find one Chipotle sets the bar.,Cv4kZH9zN0wpN2Drn0qkLg,Trying hard to be a LA street food truck.   First if you plan on going allot for a 20-30 minute wait. The seats in front of the ordering counter; side and front of the restaurant are shaped like a giant curve. They must have anticipated that their customers were going to have an extended wait. The portions are big (and according to the calorie guide on the menu high in calories) but the prices are higher than most other places.   My one big complaint is; as opposed to the LA street food carts they seem to be trying to emulate; they need to have salsa/pico Di Gallo/ --- to scoop from so the immense burritos they serve can get a scoop of your favorite dressing with every few bites. Without that they are not terribly dry but could be much better. Really if they had a fixin's bar like other similar Mexican places I would rate them a 4 star place. Faster service and a 10% reduction in price would get a 5 star review.,Cv4kZH9zN0wpN2Drn0qkLg,It's Chipotle. Consistently delicious; but also with consistently rising prices. There's nothing here I don't like.,Cv4kZH9zN0wpN2Drn0qkLg,Ah burrito bowls. You can pick your meat; your salsa; your veggies and your cheese. Load it up how you want it. Is it authentic Mexican? No; but who cares. It's good and possibly healthy. But the main point is it's good. The line always moves pretty good. Although it can get loud in there so you might have to yell your choices. It is a little pricey but so much better the dollar burritos from some other place so it is worth it. Good for lunch or dinner. So get some steak or carnitas and enjoy. Extra point because they have Coke Zero on tap. Every place gets an extra point if they have Coke Zero on tap. Also if you order on line you just walk in; skip the line; pay and you are on your way.,Cv4kZH9zN0wpN2Drn0qkLg,Love the Steak Bowl it Rocks. It is a lot of food. The prices are good; its no Taco Hell. Fast; Fresh; and Yummy. What is not to like?,Cv4kZH9zN0wpN2Drn0qkLg,This Chipotle Rocks!   Today; I express my joy In the haiku form!  Perfect fast food joint; Fresh; delicious; quick and kind. The price is right; too!  Burritos galore; In a tortilla or bowl. But wait; there is more!  Three steak tacos; please! Or grilled veggie fajitas? Oh sweet perfection.  A simple menu; Yet so many decisions. How can you go wrong?  Answer:  You cannot!   Order now; you won't regret; This Chipotle Rocks!,Cv4kZH9zN0wpN2Drn0qkLg,I haven't had Chipotle in a while; and suddenly found myself inside here waiting in a very long line to place my order.  It's been a while since I've eaten here; so I figured it was time!  When I entered; it was the dinner rush; so there was a very long line.  Ahead of me were 4 Phoenix fireman; along with a UPS driver.  Nice!   Despite the line being painfully long; I placed my order.  I got the Fajita burrito with the shredded beef.  Tasty!    I do have to give a kudos to the staff here.  Clearly; they were extremely busy; and despite that; I was treated with courtesy and a smilng face!  That goes a long way for me; as I know how frustrating it can be when you are looking at a line out the door.    I also really like how thier menu's set up.  Fairly simple; with nice choices to choose from.  Not to complicated; easy to understand and a fair price point.  Really enjoyed my time here; and the staff was wonderful. Will return in the future!,Cv4kZH9zN0wpN2Drn0qkLg,Well it was bound to happen... yes; here is my review on Chipotle. I am not a huge fan to be honest. However; I am going to be optimistic and at least mention what the best thing on their menu is.  For the longest time; I honestly hated Chipotle and couldn't put my finger on what it was that I disliked. Then I finally hit the nail on the head. Its the meat! I have tried all of their meats and all have sucked honestly. The steak and chicken are tough; don't have much flavor; and tend to have pieces with grissle. Barbeqoa is wayyy too fricken salty. Carnita's are probably the lesser of the evils but is wayyyyy to peppery. If it weren't for the hubby being a huge fan of the carnita's and guac here; I would have never gone back. But since he loves Chipotle so much and requests it once a month; I had to find something to order that is decent.  After trying tacos; salads; quesadillas; my go to meal turned out to be the vegi burro. Please don't give this review that look. Its actually good and it comes with the guacamole! Yes; I love meat and rarely order something vegetarian. However; Chipotle is the one place I prefer something vegetarian over something with meat because like I said; the meat is soooo horrible. Now when I am forced to go to Chipotle; I get a burrito with rice (I order extra); black beans; corn salsa; hot salsa; pico de gallo; extra sour cream; and guac on the side. These are the best items Chipotle has. I have to admit; their rice is actually tasty; their tortillas are soft and huge; the corn salsa is downright delicious (but who doesnt like corn); and their pico is always fresh with a pretty good flavor. Betcha noticed that I make no mention of cheese huh? Don't get me wrong; I love cheese but Chipotles cheese seems too strong for my taste. Anyways; let me sum up the food by saying that although you get alot; nothing accept the veggie burro is acceptable in my book. Even this vegi burrito is simply ok and tolerable; once in a decade craveable.  Now as for the service; some of the locations seem to hire people that lack intelligence and this location is no exception to that. Many times; there seems to be too many people behind the counter running around like chickens with their heads cut off. Also; the burritos tend to have holes in them because the roller doesn't know how to roll.  I will say that I am absolutely puzzled as to why Chipotle has such a huge following. To me; its far from being sensational. Luckily; I have found something decent to order but this is not a place that I get really excited about. About the only time I got stoked to see a Chipotle was in NY after eating multiple overpriced downright depressing meals. Maybe I was just looking for something familiar after being away from home for a week. However; when other Chipotle cravings emerge; I satisfy them and then head to the drug store to get a certain test because obviously somethin aint right!,Cv4kZH9zN0wpN2Drn0qkLg,"I've enjoyed most of the Chipolte grill dishes over the years; and they are very reasonably priced.  Is it authentic mexican food? Not really; but the ingredients they use are fresh ; and nothing seems \off\"" to me in terms of the food.  The dining experience itself; isn't much to write home about.   It's loud; and tables as well as decor are akin to being at a Denny's.  Still; I give it four stars -- not bad for a mexican food chain.""",Cv4kZH9zN0wpN2Drn0qkLg,Eh; the food is okay.  I really like their carnitas and their cilantro lime rice.  The black beans were pretty damn flavorless though.  I think for what you get it's a bit too pricey.  About a buck and a half too much in fact.  And for God's sake; why the hell does every Chipotle have to be so deafening??  Did the architect that designed Chipotle not consider acoustics when they designed the place?    My lunch was fine when I started eating at 11 AM; but by the time I was leaving and the lunch crowd had filtered in; the din of noise was like being verbally assaulted while underneath a tin pail in a hail storm.  There are no noise baffles anywhere and the corrugated tin walls and booths and concrete floors make the place uncomfortably loud.    This is not the first time I have noticed this in a Chipotle location either.  They are all like this.   Decent; if over-priced; food in an awful setting.,mTc8M-drs2HSG8paNUTTQg,What's worse than greasy Mexican food? COLD Greasy Mexican food!  I ordered the super nachos which were slathered in cold beans and unmelted cheese. Gross! My man ordered the cheese enchilada; which was also cold and full of unmelted cheese. In general; the food was cold and not satisfying. We would have given them 2 to 3 stars; since they have a salsa bar and lots of cheap combo plates. But the a/c was broken; making our dining experience even more unpleasant. Heck the restaurant was hotter than the food!  Pass it up; folks.,mTc8M-drs2HSG8paNUTTQg,They have $1 tacos Mon - Wed. Otherwise; I wouldn't go here. It's like the million other -berto's - very greasy; moderately priced and no customer service should be expected. When you need a late night/early morning snack or are just craving super greasy Mexican food; this is your place.,cRwNwAGQ8Pc_-orLefrwRw,I've been to Freddy's a dozen times; at least. My mother introduced me and my daughters to it a couple years back.  I invariably get the patty melt and love it.  Their fries are almost matchsticks; and quite tasty!  The concretes are fantastic!  Prices are reasonable for the food you get.,cRwNwAGQ8Pc_-orLefrwRw,This place is great for good at a good price. You can get a combo meal for about $6. Their burgers are made from sirloin burger and extremely good. I usually get the patty melt.  The rye bread is butter toasted and so stinkin' good!  They're small patties; so it's a good idea to order a double. The onion rings are the best I've had at a fast food restaurant.   The custard is so creamy and rich. They can make basically anything you like; but plain vanilla is pretty tasty.  The service is also outstanding. If you dine in; a manager will walk by and ask how everything was. Excellent customer service.,cRwNwAGQ8Pc_-orLefrwRw,Not really frozen custard...more like just soft served ice cream =/ the burger is okay -- the California style burger is like a single cheeseburger from In N Out but I do like their fries...crispy and very thin. The menu is mostly ice cream and sundaes.   Nothing very note worthy of this place...kinda cheap; has drive thru and big sit-in area and friendly staff.,cRwNwAGQ8Pc_-orLefrwRw,pretty much better than ANY fast food burger. and the prices aren't that bad; I tried culvers once and remember spending close to $20 for two people. you can get a burger fries and drink meal for under $5; but you gotta try the custard.,cRwNwAGQ8Pc_-orLefrwRw,Freddy's is not bad at all and the prices are reasonable. The burger is acceptably good and the shoestring fries are also on par.  Some of the employees were not that excited to be there when we went; but that didn't take too much away from the experience. Freddy's has good cheap food and for that I shall return!,cRwNwAGQ8Pc_-orLefrwRw,Freddy's is not bad at all and the prices are reasonable.

I can't rave the same about the unfriendly service though...my cashier  had  crabby pants and  had the look of a snapper turtle. Oh well...Life goes on!  Their French fries looked fantastic and YES; OUI; SI - I will be back for those...and maybe a burger also...,cRwNwAGQ8Pc_-orLefrwRw,This is my new go to spot when on the west side. I had the California style burger and it was really really good. The seasoning on the patty is perfect and I like that the buns are buttered and toasted. The fries were also really good and loved the fry sauce they have to dip them in. Had an oreo chocolate ice cream sandwich to top off the meal and it was the perfect ending. Restaurant was clean; reasonably priced and the service was quick and friendly. Fingers crossed they open a Scottsdale location in the future.,cRwNwAGQ8Pc_-orLefrwRw,This place deserves some credit. At first I thought the price was a little high but the mountain of food made up for it. Great crispy fries and the steak burger wasn't half bad; it actually tasted like steak. Didn't get a chance to try the sweets but my sons hotdog was great as we're my wife chili cheese fries. The cherry on top for me was having Code red as a selection in the fountain drinks. Freddy's = The best fast food I've ever had.,cRwNwAGQ8Pc_-orLefrwRw,"As far as a fast Burger and shake goes; this place is tops. The fries are thin and crispy but not overdone and their frozen custard is a dream. You'll know why the shake straws are half an inch thick right away; they work perfectly for the thickness of their custard shakes.  The prices aren't too high either; for the quality you get over your average fast-food place a buck or two goes a long way here.  If only they had more locations; I honestly just keep forgetting this place is around because every time I go I am immediately glad I did.   Their hot dogs are pretty \meh\"" but it is a burger place afterall; so you should be having one of those.""",cRwNwAGQ8Pc_-orLefrwRw,This place is pretty meh for the price. The steak-burger patties are VERY thin. I do not have a huge appetite and I could easily eat a triple-burger. Shoestring fries are OK if that's your thing. I prefer a little more sustenance. Frozen custard; same thing. Good for what it is; but too rich for my taste buds.,cRwNwAGQ8Pc_-orLefrwRw,I did not like the food here i think its overpriced for the veggie burger you get cause there shore isnt any meat on it . Our burger patties was so thin  it looked like the crust of the burger that sticks to the pan after you flip it like they scraped it off and slapped it on a bun. My five year old boy was still hungry after eating it. Although i am impressed by their custard! It is the best thing they got going!,cRwNwAGQ8Pc_-orLefrwRw,Why people are so high on this place is something I don't understand. The food doesn't stand out in any particular way while costing more than it really should. I think 3 stars is a generous assessment when considering the mediocrity of the food combined with the above-average prices.,cRwNwAGQ8Pc_-orLefrwRw,Why people are so high on this place is something I don't understand.

The food was as good as ever.  My wife tried their green chili burger and it was out of this world. The best in Phoenix!   In fact it was so good that I went there again last night with plans of ordering it. Unfortunately the promotion ended the day before and the burger was no more. I must say I was disappointed and ordered something else.   What I got was delicious but it just wasn't what I'd set my sights on. I must implore Freddy's to bring that green chili burger back or at the very least allow someone to order the toppings ala carte.    With that out of the way; the food is fantastic and the prices are well below what I'd expect.  You can't go wrong coming here for a meal.,cRwNwAGQ8Pc_-orLefrwRw,Went here the day they opened; expecting something at least on par with In-n-Out. Boy; was I disappointed. The burger was falling apart on the bun; and not in a good way; a la the meat being tender. No; there were small bits falling off from the burger; which itself was dry and lacking flavor; even with cheese and bacon on it. The fries? Whoever thought shoestring fries was a good idea needs to be fired. Worst fries I ever had; overcooked and under-seasoned. I would understand this if they were insanely busy on opening day; but they weren't. Aside from a couple other families; we were the only ones in the shop.  The only thing saving this place from one-star purgatory is the custard. Got a lot of it for the price; cone was huge; custard was delicious; but I suppose that's hard to screw up. With two other great places on Bell to get a delicious burger; I'm never coming back here. Very disappointing waste of money.,6pd0Z40VifMh6ETJrOw_0g,"Dude; why have I never heard of this place before! Oh; because they don't have any in California . . . damn.   Like others have said; this is an In & Out Equivalent; but in my humble opinion; I think Whataburger is better. You get more food for the same price and better service.

Everything I've tried on the menu has been fantastic; but it doesn't really matter; because I always order one of two things. To start; I always order a patty melt. Two patties; melted cheese; grilled onions and a sauce that I'd go into detail about if I wasn't concerned about alienating readers from displaying an alarming amount of affection for it. The patty melt is big and filling; but me being the careless fat man that I am I usually order a meal of chicken strips on top of it and make it a large. The meal comes with 3 strips; fries; a drink; a slice of texas toast cut diagonally (and we all know bread tastes better when cut that way); and your choice of dipping sauce. I always get gravy because it's perfect for dipping the bread into. Thank god they have diet Dr Pepper in the fountain so that I can keep this meal healthy and low-calorie. I always get spicy ketchup with my order instead of regular. I'm not sure I think it's better - in fact I'm pretty sure it's not; but sometimes the novelty wins out.  Sometimes; when I'm feeling adventurous; I make the patty melt the meal and get 2 honey butter chicken biscuit breakfast sandwiches instead of the chicken strips meal. That's where I find the only limitation with this place - they only serve breakfast between 11 PM and 11 AM.

Let me explain.  Every time I show up craving a burrito bowl; there's a huge line to the door. Each person in line is wondering why they're there. You can tell. They're wondering why they put up with the low quality; the terrible service; the indifferent management; the unacceptable price of guacamole; the attitudes of the guy asking you what you want -- or more often; telling you to hold on. The only time I've come here and not had to wait in line; this troll still told me I had to wait because they were making an order for a  family (not in attendance).  I've checked in to this place a few times; and I've been to the Chipotle by Fashion Square a few thousand. For some reason; that place is bomb and this place sucks. At this location; you have to stand in line among dine-in patrons and witness the slop that you're about to ingest and the looks of disappointment on their faces after each unfulfilling bite.  If you've already decided to eat at Chipotle; you've probably had Chipotle before. If you're like me; you go to get a burrito bowl with no rice because you're a Slow Carb or 4 Hour Body fanatic. You know that you can get what you need (not necessarily what you want). If you want a delicious authentic Mexican meal; go across the street to Julio's. If you want to hate yourself and write a whiny Yelp review about it; come here.,RIP8nL2Gbiu0zb-nCgZnpw,Grand opening for the New Chipotle out here near PV mall....and of course in walking distance of my house. I mean it simply doesn't get any better than this....so many food choices and more coming all within a stone's throw of my apartment complex. I was the 3rd person in line for this chipotle's grand opening after 3pm promotion. The first 100 people received a free burrito....burrito bowl....taco's or salad card to use on their visit.....and a biodegradable water bottle.   I had the chicken burrito with a side of chips and guacamole....it cost me about 10 bucks. While the burrito was pretty good.....the chips and guac were very salty so beware of that if you have high blood pressure issues. The restaurant is located in great locale....right near the intersection of Cactus and Tatum. I am sure it will do well in this locale especially since again it sits right near the mall.  However with Oregano's which just opened a couple of weeks ago right across from it....and a new Culver's coming that will be just down the road....and of course the already popular In and Out burger.....I am sure there will be some stiff competition for business. I am just excited it is so close to my apt. so if I ever to want Mexican....I now have my very own NEIGHBORHOOD CHIPOTLE!!!! Eat; Drink; and be Merry my Friends!!!!,iAe55bO88EwBiPL2GhwBew,These guys are awesome!!!  Fast service good quality food. The people there were very helpful and the food was outstanding. Ample quantity and they didn't skimp on the meat which is pretty common at places like this.  The veggies are always fresh and the price is spot on to where it should be for a sandwich like that.,iAe55bO88EwBiPL2GhwBew,Tasty sandwich made with fresh ingredients and my exact topping preference; friendly staff; in a bright; clean location.  This place is all that I love about Jersey Mike's!   If you've never been before; it's a really simple sub shop; similar to what you'd find on the East Coast; with fresh ingredients; yummy bread and simple decor.  They don't have a ton of fancy options; but everything is delicious!  Their vegetarian sandwich is a cheese sub with green peppers - my husband and I split the Giant.  They're a tiny bit more expensive than some other sadnwich shops; but their ingredients and service make them a big favorite with us.  Open until 9pm on Sundays!,iAe55bO88EwBiPL2GhwBew,We have been going to Jersey Mike's over the past nine years and was excited when  they recently opened this location.   Sandwich shops seem to be the new fad in the restaurant industry. What they call quick food. Maybe because of the Great Recession; but they have proven to be very resilient in a slow economy.   If I type into Yelp search: 'Sandwich'; with a 1 mile radius; I come up with no fewer then five different places.  Along with some others that do other quick food items; like Corleones and Paradise Bakery.   That said; this Jersey Mike's is convenient; clean; offers good value (when using coupons) and has a Manager/Owner on the premises; with employees who have been trained well and are friendly.   I just enjoyed a #13; Original Italian; with a bag of chips and a 22 oz drink for the coupon discounted price of $6.99 plus tax. And; I received 6 points on my Jersey Mikes Club card. The sandwich was good; with a fair amount of cold cuts on a soft piece of sub bread that held up well.  Nice.   So in summary... Go... Enjoy!,yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,I had a really tasty sandwich here; the Smokehouse Beef & Cheddar here. But I will agree with other reviewers that the sandwich could stand to be a bit bigger for the price. I liked the fact that if you accept all defaults (they ask you every step of the process how you would like your sandwich); this BBQ-sauce filled sandwich also gets mayonaisse. Most people may not like that; but I do. The combination of sweet-tangy and creamy works for my palette.  Didn't sample the impressive array of hot sauces available for spicing up one's sandwich; but always happy to see a wide selection of condiments available.   I'm tempted to come back here and try their other selections. I also liked how you can buy the house BBQ sauce in a fire-hydrant shaped bottle.,yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,I think these guys have one of the best hot subs around. I differentiate hot and cold subs because they are completely different sandwiches. There are places in town that have great cold subs but Firehouse has one of the best hot subs around. I don't think there is a bad one on the menu. I love the Italian and the New York Steamer with corned beef and pastrami but the meatball; turkey bacon ranch; club; Engineer are all great. Every time you walk in you are greeted. Now granted sometimes are more exuberant than others. Sometimes you get WELCOME TO FIREHOUSE! and sometimes you get WELCOME to fireh... but you are greeted. Even after that they still remain friendly. They will explain things if you have never been there before or if you have questions. It is always nice and clean and the soda machine is never running low. The one little knock against them is the price. It is a little expensive but so worth it. So much better than some $5 piece of junk. Every once in awhile you get a craving and it is a nice indulgence. It also makes you feel good to round up your order and donate the change to firefighters. I like that little touch too and think more people should do it. Sure it is just change but it is going toward a great cause. I will keep coming back and have a hard time picking which sandwich I want because they are all so good. They get an extra point for having a Coke Freestyle machine. Those are the best.,yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,I think these guys have one of the best hot subs around.

The two times I've been here I've had the meatball and the beef brisket sandwich- very yummy. Overall I think for the price point the sandwiches are delicious and tasty. They have a lot of interesting sauces you can try for your sandwich. The overall experience is great and I will be coming back for my yummy sandwiches. This would also be a fun place to take your family to have a sub and enjoy some subs.,yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,I heard of this place from my buddies on Chandler PD as they go there often and told me to try it.  It's a cool theme in there; one I can relate to growing up in and around the firehouse with my dad.  Lots of firetrucks; hoses; and pictures around of firemen.  Lots of hotsauces when you walk in the door - that's nice. Good subs and hoagies and affordably priced - I got a great hot sub for less than what I typically pay for at Subway. And after going to their web site and learning that they have a Foundation where they give money and tools back to First Responders... I'm definitely returning and telling everybody I know about it. And for the record; all the guys and kids working there were really nice.,yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,"Arizona's technology sector is expanding yet again. With the presence of Motorola and Intel establishing the Valley's own Silicon Desert; the industry continues to aspire to be a preeminent center of innovation and design. Biotech has garnered much of the attention recently; but even now its perch has been threatened. Yes; in the midst of economic uncertainty; one new firm has no shortage of buzz.  Yes; the cutting edge is now a sandwich knife. Firehouse Subs has come to the state; and promises to revolutionize an American original: the hoagie; or submarine sandwich. Founders Chris and Robin Sorensen realized just like other foods; the method of cooking a sandwich should be just as important as the ingredients. And so; they decided to use a heretofor underutilized way in mass-prodctions sandwich shops: steam.  But if you worry that your glasses will fog up as you walk through the door; don't be. The seemingly endless row of hot sauces will likely cause more eye irration than the patented steamer devices used behind the counter. Bowing to their time the founders worked with their father as firefighters in Jacksonville; Florida; the decor is a mix of bright reds; whites; and blacks with a very clean and new feeling throughout. Employees are quick to shout; \Welcome to Firehouse\"" when anyone steps inside.  The menu hints at ambition but ultimately delivers something more staid. Creative names like \""Hook and Ladder\"" and \""Engine Company\"" conceal prosaic offerings like ham and turkey and turkey with roast beef. But as soon as you take a bite; you'll realize that the steaming does make a huge difference. And you'll also notice how fast you finish; given that their items are on the small side.  With all the focus on next-generation technology; the owners have yet to solve 20th century vintage problems. The first is the wait that is required to use the steamer. While it's not oppressive long; it does diminish the utilty of the sandwich shop concept a little bit. Contravening this is the staff's desire to be really nice to you; even if it's all very Stepford-wife as opposed to something family-owned. We can only hope none there has seen \""Westworld\"".  Innovation; however; always costs money and you'll be keenly aware of this here. It's not that you have to shell out an unspeakable amount of money to dine at Firehouse. It's that you might feel for a simple sandwich; it's either too much (money) or not enough (food). But the restaurant's signature flavors still make it a destination; at least until the next big thing comes along.""",yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,This was my first visiting a firehouse sub and I live down the street. The staff has great customer service and very welcoming. It's pretty tough to find parking when I went during lunchtime; but that's manageable. The sandwiches were good; but for the prices it should be bigger!  Definitely a place to go for a quick place to eat during lunchtime.,yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,Located right off of Ray and 101; there isn't much parking around here at lunchtime.  It gets a little busy and crowded inside; especially the line for the Coca Cola Freestyle.  Prices are also a little high for the value considering meat quality and quantity.  The lettuce is well shredded from the corporate offices.    I've been here a few times because a friend works nearby so we've met here.  I wouldn't drive here out of my way when there are better alternatives on the other side of 101 or down on Chandler Boulevard.  Staff here is pretty welcoming and not just when you walk in.,yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,Good food; clean and friendly service. The prices are a little  high for what you get; but this is one place everyone in our family can agree on.,yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,Came here for a sub and left with a big ole smile on my face!  Firehouse subs totally hit the spot.  They serve hot subs; and was amazed at how good they tasted.  I had the #3 which was roast beef and pastrami with all the fixings.  They do have a great selection of hot sauces here; but I didn't try any of them.  The subs here come in 2 sizes; 8 inch and 12 inch.  Prices are actually quite reasonable; and I feel like I got a lot more then I paid for.  Tasty bread; a filling meal; and enough sub to make me happy.    They even sell their pickle buckets here.  Their those big drum looking things that are probably hold at least 5 gallons of goods for $2.  I guess the $2 goes towards a fireman's charity or something; but either way; its for a good cause.    Anyways; this place is worth checking out.  :-),yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,The food was great but over priced. The placed was packed yet the service was exceptional which is a rare combination. I would definitely recommend this place place to my friends just remember to save up before you stop in.,yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,I got a meatball sub from this location; and it was excellent.  Location is very clean; and staff was very friendly.  They have an online ordering option; so my food was ready to go as soon as I arrived.  The only negative is that is a bit pricey.  Over $10 for a 12 inch sub and beverage.  Not a ripoff since the food was very good; but still a little higher than I'd like to be paying for a sandwich.,yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,"One of the best sub shops hands down. Love the way they steam the subs; make them taste freaking delicious.  Really there isn't any sub on the menu you can't go wrong with. Average prices and the \Welcome to Firehouse\"" never gets old.  Give it a go and head to Firehouse!""",yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,"If your a man; this is your sammich shop!!! Its a bit pricey but it seems like most of the sammich places now a days are. The hubby loves this place. He always get \The Hero\"" which he claims is named after him. I tend to get the same thing at most sammich shops which is a turkey sammich; smoked turkey breast in Firehouses case. I will say that this is a decent sammich. The bread and other ingredients always seem to be fresh. However; its not one of those places that I crave for some reason. Honestly; I think I prefer Jimmy Johns.  Firehouse is not bad though and the atmosphere is cute; kinda like an old firehouse (imagine that!). They also have some good chocolate chip cookies    :)""",yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,Great subs with a good price,yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,"I went to Firehouse for the first time this past weekend. The place was clean and I enjoyed the decor.   The sandwiches were very good and fresh. The brisket and cheddar sandwich was really good. I also split the engine company sub with my fiancee and enjoyed the sandwich. The sandwiches were made within 5 minutes of the order.  I liked the crushed ice instead of the cube you typically get at most eating esablishments.   I didn't find the food too expensive. The cost for 2 sandwich combos was $16-17.  About what you would pay at Dilly's.  I expect I will hear \Welcome to Firehouse\"" in the future.""",yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,"I went to Firehouse for the first time this past weekend.

I expect I will hear \Welcome to Firehouse\"" in the future.""",yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,"To start this out with; let me make it clear I have experience with Firehouse Subs. I'm from the East Coast; where they originate. I had one one block away from my campus housing while I was in college; and another resided in the same building as a friend of mine's condo during that same time.   With that out of the order; Firehouse is good. Very good. A large combo is a little pricier than a deal at Subway (a large combo is ~$10); but it's definitely worth it. The medium combo is ~$7.50; but the large is; I feel; well worth it; as the sandwich is so much bigger.  For starters; your sub is steamed. STEAMED! The way God meant meat and cheese to be prepared on a sandwich.   This comes at a price; however. Don't expect the 'have it your way' mentality of Subway; you have a choice of ~10 subs; each of which comes with a selection of meats and cheeses. Some of these can be served fully involved (mayo; mustard; lettuce; tomato); others can not (I'm looking at -you-; Steamer. You'd be perfect if you'd just loosen up a bit and take some extra condiments like a good girl). Well; you might be able to explicitly ask if they can be served that way; but it's going to be up to the server; the ones that are to be served fully involved (if you want them that way) say \Served Fully Involved\"" on the menu.  But my God; even with these limits is it worth it. These sandwiches are large; filled with meat and cheese; tasty as hell; and Firehouse provides a huge assortment of hot sauces to include on it. USE THEM! Find one you like; it really does make the sandwich taste better. I nearly cried when I found out a friend had been eating at Firehouse but had never known the hot sauces were there to be tried and experimented with by the customers; and so had never had the joy of a hot sauced sub.  Now; the reason this isn't 5 star...because of what has been done to the Firehouse Subs brand hot sauce. Yes; they have their own. Back in GA; it was -amazing-; best hot sauce there. Mild enough you could slather it on like ketchup; spicy enough to give it some heat; and tangy enough to give it flavor. I'm not sure why the one here was different (different mixing location? Different (bad) batch from those I've had in the past? I don't know); but it was a little bit spicier than it should have been (making it so my usual habit of slathering it on made the sandwich a little more spicy than I like. Still good; still edible; but not perfect); and less tangy.   Still; though; try Firehouse the next time you want a sub. It's so much better than those other; lesser; sub shops.""",yTFdhqH9eLzaP05xXQa2rw,"The thing that really sets Firehouse Subs apart from its competitors is its amazing service. Even over the noon hour--the busiest time of day--at least one employee greets you at the door. Everyone who works there is cheerful and courteous. They deliver the food to your table; And the food arrives quickly.  The food is consistently flavorful. Their menu is standardized; so if you want a sub made your way; you would be better off at Subway. They will leave off certain ingredients if you ask; but the options are limited. I don't mind this because it makes the line go quicker. You don't wait 20 minutes for the people in front of you to pick their ingredients.  The soda machine with 200+ flavors is way cool. One benefit is that there is normally a single line behind the machine. You don't have people crashing into or cutting in front of each other as happens with traditional soda fountains. I happened to talk recently with a fellow who works for Coca-Cola. He said these machines cost around $17;000; so any business that has at least one of them must be doing well.  The cashier always asks whether you would like to round up your purchase to the next dollar to benefit the Firehouse Public Safety Foundation. Normally; I dislike it when cashiers ask you to donate to the store's favorite cause because I already give to my own favorite causes. However; I always say \yes\"" at Firehouse because donating to first responders is definitely a good cause; assuming that the money goes where they say it does.  As other reviewers have mentioned; the food is pricey. For a few dollars more; you could get a decent meal at a sit-down restaurant.  Sadly; I no longer eat at Firehouse Subs because I recently became a vegetarian; and they don't offer a vegetarian option. I'm sure they would leave the meat off one of their salads on request; but when I go to a sub place; I want a sub. So I eat at Subway instead; even though the quality; service; and atmosphere are lacking by comparison.  If you are carnivorous; I highly recommend Firehouse Subs.  UPDATE:  After posting this as a four-star review; a representative of Firehouse Subs private messaged me to address a few of the concerns I expressed above. She informed me that they do indeed have a vegetarian sub on the menu. She also explained more about the Firehouse Public Safety Foundation.  Since posting the original review; I have returned to Firehouse Subs in Chandler twice. Each time I ordered the veggie sub. The reason I wasn't aware of it earlier is that it is not on the big menu behind the counter. I found it listed only on a small revolving menu on the countertop. I would suggest that they do more to promote the veggie sub because it's good. It is much more flavorful than its counterpart at Subway. If you order The Works and ask them to skip the mayo; it's fairly healthy.  Also; I want to clarify that in the original review; I did not mean to imply that their Foundation is shady. I was simply trying to be objective; i.e.; I did not want to state something I could not verify. After learning more about the Foundation and reading more about it on the Internet; I think it's well respected and does great work. Certainly; there are few causes more important than helping first responders.  Primarily because I like their veggie sub; I have upped my original rating to five stars. I may be taking some risk in doing so because Yelp seems to be more likely to filter five-star reviews.

All in all; PeiWei's food will be why I don't return anytime soon even though their staff was excellent and so was the atmosphere.,pAu8UuWTLTLai61TW8-tZw,Pei Wei is a fast; easy; cheaper PF Chang's - and that's what makes it great! If you like the tofu dishes at PF Chang's; you'll love Pei Wei. The food here is great. The service is exceptional. And the portions are huge! I usually end up taking about half the food home with me. Also; compared to other lunch spots near by (like Paradise Bakery); it's really not all that busy. Of course; it's not authentic Asian food; but you shouldn't be expecting that when you come here anyway.,pAu8UuWTLTLai61TW8-tZw,"Took the family there last week.  Ordered fried wontons; sweet and sour beef; Mongolian beef; honey crusted chicken and pad Thai noodles.    The Mongolian beef was delicious; however the white rice was undercooked; some of the rice was hard still and crunchy.  Honey crusted chicken also quite good; same story with the rice.  Same thing with the sweet and sour beef.  Ordered the Pad Thai without peanuts... Son is allergic to peanuts so we made it very clear we didn't want anything with nuts.  They deliver the pad Thai with peanuts all over the top.  Sent it back and they fixed it.  They brought us spring rolls which we did not order.  We said they were not ours we ordered wontons.  They bring us the wontons a few minutes later.  The wontons are less expensive than the spring rolls; we point that our to the guy at the register and with a bit of smart-alecky-ness says that he \let us keep the spring rolls\"" and \""didn't charge is for all of our drinks\"" as if he did us a favor.  Overall the food was decent; the rice was terrible and the attitude of the cashier was not what I expected with a $65 food order!!  I wouldn't go back for that price and food quality but perhaps we caught them on a bad day..""",pAu8UuWTLTLai61TW8-tZw,"Took the family there last week.

It's right near stores and other restaurants; as well as neighborhoods. The food is outstanding and the prices are reasonable. I would love to eat here again!,pAu8UuWTLTLai61TW8-tZw,Wife and I went last week and we should go more often. Sat at the counter watching the Cooks perform their magic; and they are very friendly...Started with the Pork Egg Rolls; a bit overpriced and not enough veggies in the roll... Wife had the Chicken Teriyaki with noodles... Tasted hers and it was very good.. I had the new Thai Lime Chile Beef with brown rice... I could eat there everyday.. O.K. maybe twice a day! The quality is great; P.F.CHANG GOOD!,pAu8UuWTLTLai61TW8-tZw,Found this the other night.  It is the PF Chang fast food option and it worked perfectly for us.  Limited menu; but lower prices. Very basic decor; but clean and fast seating.  Lettuce Wraps just as good as Chang's.  Very busy; especially the take out.  Glad to have it close,pAu8UuWTLTLai61TW8-tZw,Same consistent quality and service; just like locations in ca; San Marcos and others.  Good for group of 8.  Prices are reasonable; you can order a few items and try it all; family style. Prices $8 to $15 range.,pAu8UuWTLTLai61TW8-tZw,I ordered the teriyaki bowl and it was great food for the price.  Quite impressed by the variety of options on the menu. Not sure if this location was the one I tried.,l9Xqi_FUukoExs7nBa422w,"This was my first visit to a Culver's restaurant. My first observation was the outside area; it was clean and litter free with ample parking. The inside was also very clean and neat; as was the bathroom.  The owner of the store personally took my order and he was friendly and very professional. I ordered the \Culvers Deluxe\"" platter; which included fries and a drink. The double meat; double cheese burger came piled high with bacon and fresh veggies. The burger was excellent; hot and plenty of juice. Fries were ok; crispy; could have been more of them. Overall; prices are about average for a burger combo. The food was above average for a fast food joint. The staff was friendly and helpful. I give Culver's a thumbs up and I am sure I will visit them again.""",l9Xqi_FUukoExs7nBa422w,The good? Well it is better than Pete's.  When my mom was in town this Spring I decided to buy her dinner at Culver's after a few people recommended it. My aunt strongly recommended the seasonal walleye so I went for it.  First off this review is partially my fault. I'm an active Yelper. It is usually my fault when my expectations are off. I expected a casual sit down place like Denny's or Big Boys. So it is my fault for not doing my homework.  Second; it is less fast casual and more fast food. I got the impression from a few people that this was a fast casual place. But it felt more like McDonald's with a few seasonal specials to me.  Third. The food. My wife thought her friend chicken was okay. My walleye was better than Pete's and other fast food joints. But on par with decent fish and chips? No. And it cost more than my last trip to our favorite fish and chips joint.  The restaurant even looked messier than most McDonald's I've been to.  Next time; I'm going to remember to check before offering to treat family to dinner even if I have a recommendation. Because this place was disappointing and I would've rather spent the money to buy some fish; oil; beer; potatoes and make dinner for twice as many people for the same price.,l9Xqi_FUukoExs7nBa422w,The good?

Food was very good when this restaurant first opened.  Just went there 01/18/2014. I ordered the chicken dinner to go; and it was the worst crap ever.  First the cashier ran back and asked the cook if there was any chicken.  I received 2 legs and  thighs which tasted and looked like it sat under a heat lamp for hours.  For the price your paying u think it would be fresh!  Quality has definitely went down.  Will never again go to this culvers location again.,MpMkOGrzCEGrO0-8yoib2w,The food is tasty but it's over priced for what you get. Also I'm not really supporting their business much anymore since they have an issue with equality. I notice we don't really have cravings to eat here because we're just reminded of their views and with that disappointment we tend to choose somewhere else to go. Which is sad; since my mom had been taking me to chick-fil-a's since the late 80's! Also; last time we went they were playing Christian music as if they needed to prove something. You should really respect ALL potential customers that could walk through your doors. So much disappointment.,MpMkOGrzCEGrO0-8yoib2w,My favorite fast-food place.  Great food combined with best-in-class service.  The people are always friendly!  I love their chicken.  It beats KFC; Church's; and anyone else you can name.    I especially appreciate three very unique things about them - 1. They are closed on Sundays.  I admire that!  2. The have a family night on Monday.  Kids get a 4 piece nugget meal with every adult combo meal.  3.  Their kid's meal comes with an EDUCATIONAL game or toy!  Their meal also preaches character instead of the latest Disney or Dreamworks movie - sorry Shrek!  A class A place with great food; great service; and competitve prices.  (Sorry; no dollar menu though.),MpMkOGrzCEGrO0-8yoib2w,I have always enjoyed the flavor of Chick-Fil-A Chicken.  Although it is pricey;  it's well worth the cost.  I get excited everytime I see a new restaurant opening.  I'm not a iced tea drinker so I have never experienced any fungus in my beverage.  That does concern me but I will continue to enjoy their chicken.  Keep up the good work.  I also appreciate a business that stays true to their values over financial gain.,MpMkOGrzCEGrO0-8yoib2w,I have always enjoyed the flavor of Chick-Fil-A Chicken.

I came here to wait while my husband was in an interview. I had heard things about them in the news.   Just one dollar sign is in the price range. No way; not even close. For $7; you get a puny salad and a drink. A value meal is ~ $8. Christian or not; it's such a rip-off.   And the girl that served me had a creepy attitude. When I said \thank you\"" to her twice; for ringing me up and bringing me the food; she responded with a weird; melodramatic \""Pleasure...\""  All the 5 stars below must be employees.""",58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,JUNE 2014: It's been a while since I've been in so I thought I would update my review --- FOR THE BETTER! The Codfather serves AUTHENTIC British fish & chips like you would find at the village chippy in England. Authentic texture and flavor; especially with malt vinegar and salt like you should. I've tried everyone else in town with their quirky British names and pub atmospheres; but guess what? Their fish n chips doesn't EVEN compare. I had the tilapia lunch special with an extra piece of fish. The talapia has a different texture and taste than the cod of course. Ask for extra crispy! Crunchy batter is what it's all about! This would work better with the cod since it's a moister fish. The chips are the most authentic as well.  The place has improved GREATLY since I've been there last. You enter at the left door now at the pub area and you're seated by friendly uniformed staff. It used to be that you order at the counter and then seat yourself. Much more like a proper restaurant now which is a big plus. Arrived in time last week for the second half of a World Cup game with England playing. There was absolutely NO OTHER PLACE TO BE for the game! Screens were everywhere.  Also the beer selection has greatly improved. Friday and Saturday still have the all you can eat fish at $12.95 I think. The price went up over the years but hey my original review was 2007. We had to wait a while for our meals but that's OK they were backed up a bit. I'm sure it will be OK when you go. The taste and texture of the fish n chips were PERFECT.,58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,"We visited The Codfather recently; not really knowing what to expect nor really having any preconceived notions; as I hadn't looked on Yelp yet.    First impressions - I was really disappointed that there wasn't more of a pub atmosphere.  The interior is very close to being fast food; and not even as nice as some.  You order at a counter and the food is delivered to your table.  I would agree with the earlier reviewers on some things.  I ordered the large portion of the Cod fish & chips.  I thought the portion size and the fish were quite good.  The batter was crispy and not greasy.  The chips were terrible though.  They were limp; soggy and tasted as if the oil should have been changed about two weeks ago.  I also had some shrimp which were good; but not outstanding.  I too was put off by the cheap \nickel and dime\"" approach - $.25 for more tartar sauce????  And I didn't like the $.35 surcharge for using my debit card.  I thought for a minute I was at ARCO's fish and chips!!     So; the fish was a 4; the chips were a 1; and the decor was maybe a 3.  I have to stretch to give The Codfather a 3 overall.  We will probably keep getting the fish; but for take-out.""",58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,Take a trip to GB without leaving AZ!  If you are looking for the ambience of an English pub; you won't find it here. If you are looking for authentic English pub food; you WILL find it at Codfather's! (We've traveled to the UK many times and enjoyed traditional pub food a lot. I don't consider myself an authority; but I do feel comfortable making the claim that Codfather's is authentic). They even have a little area set aside selling authentic British candy; sauces; teas; biscuits; and more!   Of course; fish and chips is the first thing that comes to min when thinking pub food; and Codfather's does not disappoint. Cod; catfish; Mahi Mahi; salmon; haddock; halibut... grilled or fried? Small or large? One doesn't get that many options in the UK!! Plus; you get a side dish - how about mushy peas or baked beans? So British! Or perhaps you fancy meat: they offer pies; pasties; sausage; etc. And of course; you can get bangers and mash; or bubble and squeak;  or a ploughman's platter or even an English breakfast.   The portions sizes are very generous. The small fish and chips is big; the large order is bigger! But the ultimate deciding factor is taste. Again; no disappointment. The fish was fried perfectly; not greasy at all and the batter is delicious. The Cornish pasty was huge (half went home to enjoy the next day.)  The beer selection is awesome; too (some bottled; some on tap.) I've never found John Smith's Extra Smooth anywhere else in town!! In addition to the other UK beers (Boddington's Guinness; Fullers); they offer domestics such as Bud & Coors (why; I have no idea!!) as well as small selection of wine.  Service was great; prices are very reasonable and friendly/welcoming staff. Don't be deterred by the location - make your way to 16th & Bell; and enjoy great pub food at this family owned restaurant.,58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,"I think John's 10/25/11 review is the most helpful; and so I can only share some of my observations. I think this place would be really cool if it were retro-60's British fish & chips; the sort of place Austin Powers would have gone to. *Contemporary* British is a huge problem for me if it means huge banners of Prince William or Harry or Whoever It Is & What's-Her-Name and God Save The Queen coffee mugs with the queen on it. Huge turn-off for me. I'm just glad they (England) got the 2012 Olympics because that will inevitably make for a more pleasant dining experience.   I don't like LJS's fast-food \fish\"" at all. I did like The Codfather's fish & chips here; tastes much better. I also liked that their silverware (even at lunch) is some damn fine china - especially for a \""fish and chips\"" place.   I do think The Codfather would work better as a \""bar\"" bar ONLY; or a fish & chips place ONLY; because there does seem to be a weird disconnect depending upon where you sit. The whole Sports-Game-on-TV-That-Doesn't-Match-The-Sound-(Music)-You-Hear thing that's common in a lot of places.   Based upon my experience and observations; I don't think The Codfather deserves so many negative reviews. Just doesn't describe The Codfather I went to.     Service: Acceptable/Good  Prices: Reasonable Environment: Will be better once the Olympics happen""",58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,I'm really disappointed that I have to write such a poor review for this place.  I'm not a big fan of fish; but I love it when it's all fried up and served with fries; so I wasn't worried about coming here.  When we walked in; I was a little confused at the setup; but it kind of grew on me.  It was very clearly a mom and pop style place; and I can definitely appreciate that.  The decor was pretty awful; but endearing at the same time.  I'm not sure why they were trying to cover up their wood tabletops with awful cheap tablecloths; but to each their own.  I also liked their impressive selection of British foodstuffs.  I wasn't too hungry; so I ordered the smaller portion of the cod and chips.  I really liked that they gave you the option to order a little less.  Maybe I was under the wrong impression that this should be a faster service restaurant because you order at a counter and pay at the counter; but our food took forever to get out to us.  The unfortunate things was seeing the cook put our fries onto our plate well before the fish made it.  That left us with lukewarm fries.  The fries; well; they sucked.  They weren't the crispy kind and they weren't salted at all.  The fish; I hate to say it; was disgusting.  It was over-battered and wasn't cooked long enough.  That left me with a nasty mess of mush all over my fish.  I had to scrape it all of to be edible.  Since this place calls themselves the Codfather; and I wasn't pleased with what is supposedly their specialty; I certainly don't see myself coming back.,58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,We go here once every few months.  The beer is great and they have a good selection.  The decor seems to struggle to find itself; but if the food is really good; who cares what it looks like.  They have added table service; which was not so great; but the beer was good; so......  Always get the cod fish and chips.  It all seems to cost more than it should; but I don't mind if I am supporting a local business.  The only thing I will remember is to face away from the kitchen space; because you can see everything they are doing in there; it's a bit unnerving and I don't care for having to ask for a key to the restroom.,58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,This place is truly a Gem among Gems...it gets The Highest Review for a few reasons: Great Food. Very authentic English Cod and awesome Pasties!   They also have a mini English-only mart with British snacks (Smarties; Crunchies; Walkers Chips and much more) they EVEN have Barley Water if you're looking for bitterness in a bottle.   The BEST part; however; is the Bar which is NOT very big; but don't let the size and strip-mall feel deceive you; they probably have one of the best and most diverse draft beer selections in town. On Tap is NewCastle; London Pride; & Tetley's as for others they have Smithwicks; Kilt Lifter and they're always rotating great other beers in and out.   They also have a Guinness Surger which takes pure but flat Guinness and sends an ultra-sonic pulse through the pint glass; releasing the gases in the Guinness beer; which then settles into a smooth velvet pint with a creamy head. In my opinion BETTER than Guinness draft; you MUST try one!  They have a very cool Tuesday Open-Mic Night and other nightly specials. It's inexpensive; with a friendly staff and not too far off the 51 or the 101...All around a 5/5!,58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,Fish is very good and the chips are good if you don't get them to go. The bar area has a good selection of beers on tap (Kronenbourg being my favorite) The staff are friendly and the prices reasonable. As other reviewers have said - the decor is simple; and does remind me of Fish and Chip Shops back in England (I am an ex-pat) The grocery section has a decent selection and you can find some decent imported English foods,58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,Great fish & chips... Very very pricey for what u get!  Unless you go on friday... but the Halibut is crazy expensive... One piece for 11 bucks... ??? Yeah....,58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,Great fish & chips... Very very pricey for what u get!  Unless you go on friday... but the Halibut is crazy expensive... One piece for 11 bucks... ??? Yeah....,58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,Unlike other fish 'n chips places in the city; this one offers other British fare as well: bangers and mash; bubble and squeak; and more (see the menu board pic I posted). I ordered the small cod and small order of fries; plus a crab cake. The fries were cut a bit thicker than you would find at most fast food places (this does have the look of a fast food joint; except for the bar area). I had anticipated mediocre fries at most; having previously read some of the reviews here; but  the batch I got was quite good; crispy outside; moist and tender within. The same description could be applied to the fish - except that the battered cod was swimming in oil; and the fries were not. The crab cake was a good size - about the size of the palm of a hand - and just as thick; had lots of crab meat but also quite a bit of surimi (imitation crab) as an extender. That was OK; it still tasted good and I like surimi. Like the fish; though; it was drenched in oil. I'm thinking of coming back to try the other fare; or even the fish and crab cake again - they're tasty and not expensive. I just need to take the precaution of letting a paper napkin soak up much of the oil first.,58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,Roy 'The Hungry Englishman'  For those of you who are in a rush then my 'Five Star' rating says it all; this place is the best and importantly the most AUTHENTIC 'Chippy' that I have yet to find in the US.  However as is usual with my reviews I feel a little more in-depth comments are warranted so if you feel so inclined here you go.  As you have likely guessed from my moniker I am English born and bred; although  I must say it is my very good fortune to now call this wonderful country my home.  To the surprise of my (American) wife I don't get homesick at all but it is true to say that I do occasionally crave the odd bite or two that I grew up on; fish and chips included.  To this end my ever thoughtful wife has always been keen to find me an 'authentic' fish & chip restaurant as we travel this great country and I can say that finally we found one at the Codfather in Phoenix Arizona of all places.  I have tried so called 'authentic' British fish & chips all over the country and although most have been a very pleasant meal 'authentic' they were certainly not.  For one thing if you mention 'mushy peas' they look at you rather strangely whereas this is likely one of the most common sides you can get at every single 'chippy' in good old Blighty.  And don't get me started on the battered fish (or lack there of)....aside from the batter being wrong so called 'authentic' British fish & chip restaurants here in the US are under the misguided illusion that two 'finger' sized portions of fish is the thing to offer; when anyone who has ever eaten the real thing knows that one always gets a large filet of fish (usually hanging over the edge of your plate).  Anyway enough of my ranting on about all the places that are getting it wrong and let me chat about the ONLY place I have yet found that is getting it totally RIGHT..namely the Codfather.  What can I say.....FINALLY...a real Chippy..!  The place is very unpretentious but pleasant and comfortable; I think the lady owner is British as I heard an accent in the background and sadly the opportunity to introduce myself didn't arise (perhaps next time; cuz you know I'm going back).  I ordered my standby old favorite (fish; chips & mushy peas) and I was not disappointed; everything was just like I grew up on; totally authentic; so much so I over stuffed a little and couldn't eat for the rest of the day.  The 'chippy' also has a little British grocery section in; so I took advantage and stocked up on a few goodies.  It is also worth pointing out that the price for the meal was very reasonable indeed.  This I found very pleasing as growing up in a poor neighborhood with not much money as a kid; fish & chips was always a cheap meal  (hence the phrase 'cheap as chips').  Perhaps Americans won't find the real British fish & chips to their taste and that's okay but if you really do want to experience the real thing then this is the place to go.  Whenever my wife and I travel down to Phoenix (about every six weeks) we are going to make it a priority to have our lunch at the Codfather.  I would like to say a sincere 'well done' to the proprietors for a great experience and creating a genuine bit of Britain here in the US.

Happy eating; Roy,58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,"The Codfather was one of those places I wasn't expecting too much from and got way more than I expected. I've now ate almost everything on the menu in some form or another and I have never been underwhelmed with anything I have gotten. They have a great beer selection and a fantastic selection of fried appetizers.   The fish and chips are definitely the flagship here but don't sleep on their more traditional stuff. The pies are great here and bangers and mash and all of the different \versions\"" of it on the menu are all fantastic. If I had to recommend my favorite dishes to a newcomer here other than the obvious fish and chips platter the \""banger; bubble & squeek;  and beans\"" and the \""beef and kidney pie\"" are both my favorites the deep fried sausage is also one of those things where it's so good you don't care about the heart attack it's going to for sure give you.  Pros: I have ate here at least 15 times trying most if not everything on the menu and I have never had anything bad or even so-so. Everything has been steller. As long as you understand you are eating at a fish n chip/fried food joint and not a fancy seafood resteraunt you won't be dissapointed. They also have a pretty great beer selection on tap.  Cons: Now even though I can promise you I have never ate something here that wasn't good if I seriously had to nit pick a con here it would have to be pricing. I feel like EVERY dish excluding the English breakfast I pay 1 dollar too much for. Just comparing it to similar resteraunts serving similar things this place is a little pricier than most. It's not so overpriced that it should stop you from eating here but it does prevent me from say; eating there regularly; even though the food deserves it. They also seem to have a difficult time keeping the beer they have on tap stocked regularly. Every time I sit at the bar at least one beer on tap is out. Meh. Not a big deal but just an observation.  All in all \""The Codfather\"" is one of those places that you not only have to try but will undoubtedly make you want to come back again and again. The only reason it doesn't have the 5 star is that I can't walk in there and have a beer and meal and walk out spending less than 30 dollars after the tip. A little more than I expect when going to a place like that. But WOW they are seriously consistently great with everything they have on that menu! Highly recommended.""",58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,This place is awesome!  It is a little pricey; but sometimes they have an all-you-can-eat fish and chips special for about $10 which is totally worth it.  The food is authentic; I haven't had fish and chips this good anywhere else in Phoenix (especially not at Pete's) the chips are cut thick; the fish is fresh and tastes hand battered; the fillets are whole. Plenty of tartar sauce and malt vinegar too.  If you're into beer; the place has a great selection of Euro brews. There's Soccer on the TVs; they sell all kinds of awesome Irish and Scottish and British foods; and they have some of the wildest flavors of Potato Crisps from England also.  The place is absolutely packed on Fridays; so expect a wait. They also close a bit early; like around 8pm typically. So plan your trip. It's worth the trouble.,58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,I was born & raised in New England; Moved to the San Francisco Bay Area; visited the UK  and later lived on Maui ;Hawaii so I know good fish & chips. I can speak with some authority when I say here in Phoenix good fish & chips is hard to find.   The good news is The Codfather Fish and chips is the way it was meant to be made.  A large crispy coating; and fries deep fried to perfection.  If you are looking for this classic dish; you will not find a better place than the Codfather. GIANT piece of fried fish and it was delicious. Crispy; soft; juicy; flavourful; perfect with a little vinegar. Amazingly delicious. the chips were golden; fluffy; crispy on the outside but not so much that they can't absorb a generous amount of malt vinegar. For the price; could you really ask for more  My wife & I ordered the cod; which was a HUGE portion and a side of large chips.  The cod was breaded and cooked to a perfectly crispy and crunchy consistency; while still maintaining the moist fish.     FOOD: I ordered the cod; which was a HUGE portion and a side of large chips.  The cod was breaded and cooked to a perfectly crispy and crunchy consistency; while still maintaining the moist fish. I can say that the fish was fresh and the oil that it was cooked in was clean. The fish was fresh as it didn't taste fishy. The fries were lightly fried and it didn't taste too oily which was a good thing. The The chips were delicious ! PRICE: For the price; could you really ask for more.CONCLUSION:  Grab that malt vinegar and pour it on; because this fish and chip stop is the one to enjoy.,58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,"My Wife and I went yesterday around 11:45 a.m. for lunch with high expectations... That was our first error... The second was ordering food... As a teenager many many years ago I worked at a place called Bit Of England Fish and Chips in Tarzana Ca. Well the best thing eaten yesterday were the Malt Vinegar Onions... They were great; but that's where the greatness ENDS... We ordered the Onion Rings and my wife said;\Do you taste any onion? I know it was there but tasteless. The batter was light. Then we ordered a Large order of Cod And Catfish... The Chips(fries) were good. The Fish had a taste; unfortunately it was a taste of grease and no fish taste. The Catfish was a little better than the Cod. There was a greasy film left in my mouth that was a lingering memory. Still no one beats Pier 83 or George and the Dragon...service was good; but don't understand why they incur labor cost of a wait staff when you should be able to walk up to a counter and order.. Another 15%-18% wasted... If service is decent or good we never penalize the wait staff for lousy food; they didn't cook it...""",58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,"Food was a 4 Decor was a 3 Music on Tuesday 4.5  Hey; I stopped by this authentic British Fish N Chips joint last night and was surprised that I could not find a spot near the restaurant  entrance to park at the parking lot was full and this was a small strip center on Bell road with retail and service stores that were all closed. The place was relatively full for a Tuesday night at 7PM...more on that.  Since I felt like having authentic \Fish and Chips\"" the very nice lady behind the counter says \""What kind of fish\""? They have traditional Cod and Halibut and Salmon and Corvina. Plus Shrimp and Scallops and a lot more.Well in as much as I have been trying to minimize the fried foods in my life; I felt that I was down a Quart of Oil....so what the heck. Hey I just ran the 1/2 marathon last week; so go for it.   Had a piece of cod and the scallops as well and an order of onion rings. I must say; I was impressed with the fish and scallops. Very crispy cod and a nice portion as well. I had 10 scallops ($6.00) which are scallops and nothing else but for $6.00. Pretty good.  Was not impressed with the miniscule serving of tartar sauce and it's $.25 extra per serving (about a tablespoon). Well I must admit I like a little fish with my Tartar sauce. Don't get me wrong; I was impressed with the flavor of the food. I guess I just had too much oil. Maybe that's why I did not like the onion rings as much. They were good but by now; I reached my limit of oil.Again; fish is expensive and these portions were very nice.  Here's the biggest surprise and would have given The Codfather another 1/2 star if Yelp allowed half stars which I guess they don't. It's open mike Tuesday and there was a pretty decent band playing. 4 pieces; Banjo; bass; 2 guitars. After a few sets; a duet with a gal and guitar and a guy playing a mandolin were next. Pretty good; gave the place a nice buzz; people were listening and it was an added bonus to my Tuesday meal.   Finally....Thursday night these Brits open it up to an Irish Band (Raic) and I'm going to go...for some food and music. A very nice surprise in N. Phoenix. They might get to 4 stars soon.   all the best""",58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,The Codfather is my new neighborhood spot. I love this little place; and for many good reasons.  I'm huge on service; and am not afraid to indulge in food and beverage alone and therefore; I usually elect to sit at the bar most places. The Codfather is no exception.   Meet Jordan. He is always quick to greet me with a smile; and after my first visit he has remembered my drink order each time. Never an empty drink; and not just mine. This guy knows what he's doing behind his small; but always busy bar. Not long after my first sip; I'm greeted by Mark. Mark; owns the joint. You can usually find him chatting with; and greeting guests near the bar.   Great fish and chips. The jalapeno poppers are my favorite to snack on here; made in house; huge and cheesy! Killer happy hour with includes $2 domestic bottles and $1 off pints; which is a nice selection to choose from.   Great atmosphere; awesome service; good food; and nice price points. Not to mention a pretty cool eclectic group of regular guests. Overall; just a good spot. Keep it up Mark and Jordon!,58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,"I have to start with an old UK Joke.   \How did you find the steak and kidney pie? \""     \""I moved a chip...    The plusses. They have hard cider:) The chips are not those evil stringy jokes  that  pass for fast food places \""or the  crisp and crunchy variants they are pretty  close to decent home made chips  but  having grown up in the uk and eating this for  3-4 years during college   ( and they wonder why Scots have the most heart disease  outside of  New Orleans:))   this is  not just like home.       This is still very much  fish and chips at the \""sit down\""   rather than take out level. E.g   They are adequate but  didn't kick me back  nostalgia wise and  so far in the US I've not found decent ( aka bad:)  UK food that didn't come out of one or two suppliers  in the states and was lovingly heated to the same directions.   The steak and kidney pie; holy heck it was lame. I'm eating offal here so you have to give me some credit for knowing when the piss is being taken.   It's not an fully enclosed pie like they would serve in the UK which is finger food meant to be consumed on the move which doesn't describe this 80% crust to filling ratio at all.  This needs a fork; and  not that big a one cos three  trawls of the pieplate was all I  got out of it.  So far the only place that has gotten remotely  close to UK pastry  is the  Cornish pastie co in Tempe. Seriously this alone took it from 3 to 2 stars.If it cost $2 more but actually contained the advertised ingredients in identifiable lumps I'd be happier as it is less insulting  in the long run.   Nearly everyone else fakes it  and cooks a filling; then crust and marries them later  to heat. Having ketchup in packets is just bloody annoying; not having brown sauce out  likewise.       Hint  Cross the road. Go to the Indian grocery ; to their freezer  section and get their steak and kidney pie /  steak pie /  any pie   ; Go to Codfather for chips;  stick the two together.""",58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,Loved it. It's a mom-and-pop sort of place; but the fish and chips were delicious; and the prices were very reasonable. Had the cod and a banana fritter for dessert. Great stuff.,58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,"Homey atmosphere; very good selection of beers with European selections. Okay customer service but high turnover but terrible food hygiene. Worst yet; denial by the owner that it couldn't possibly be theirs even when you see a young gentleman in the back with long hair (in his defense he was wearing a hairnet but the hair was in the batter). Absolutely zero address to the hair that was fried in with the fish to us. They did ask if I wanted another serving as I declined with a grimace but they still had the audacity to charge me full price. After I told them \c'mon at least take off the fish; the owners disputed amongst themselves again of what to do; really loud so I can hear them as they look at me. Then the wife comes up to the register rings up a new check and leaves; again not a word; no apology. The new guy that's only been there two weeks tells me the new amount is 20% off excitedly yet NO APOLOGY! This place cannot afford to compensate fish much worse any apologies whatever happened to good ole customer service?   PS. My husband and I initially believed their denial \""it's not us we don't have long hair\"" till the long hair dude came out he said he didn't have a hairnets at all at that time!""",58P3oSd8P2QNzHrQmRqQZw,Why are there two listings on Yelp for this place?  Ever since my trip to Europe last March 2008; I get a hankering for real beer-battered fish and chips now and then. This pairing is not complete in my mind until you serve it with a steaming hot side of mushy peas. As it would turn out; mushy peas are hard to come by here in the desert; but I am not one to give up so easily. (Rosie's; by the way; doesn't have this buttery little delicacy; reminiscent of Linda Blair on a particularly possessed and angry day.) To my sheer delight; The Codfather did not disappoint! Though just a bit mushier than I remember them being across the ocean; these mushy peas are seasoned well and have a nice buttery flavor.  There are a variety of fish on the menu for your liking. I had the 4 oz. portion of the traditional cod and found it to be more than enough; good flavor and good texture. It sat atop a modest portion of soggy chips in a plastic basket lined with wax paper and was served with a small serving of tartar sauce in a clear plastic bucket with a lid (cocktail sauce was an option too). My husband had the 7 oz. portion of sea bass served on a plate and I did not like it as much - it was a bit too soggy throughout. After tasting my cod; he said he wished he had ordered the same instead.  SAVING GRACES: Fun mementos throughout! The Union Flag; a photo of the Queen; Charles and Diana; a double decker bus; a sign for Picadilly Circus...The menu! Everything British; from Scottish Eggs to Cornish Pasties; Even the dessert is fried; so go elsewhere if you're recovering from your bypass surgery.  GRIPES: Greasy fish & chips difficult to eat in the small plastic basket - a plate would have been helpful. Need patience to squeeze out enough ketchup from the little packets on the tables. Being environmentally minded and too hungry to waste time tearing open 10 little ketchups; a refillable squeeze bottle would have been great. They use them for the hot sauce instead...a little misleading. Stingy serving of tartar sauce served with all portion sizes of fish. Extra sauces will cost you .25 cents each. More like a diner and less like a pub.  Imagine! A little taste of nostalgia only 5 minutes from my house. And at under $10; my husband is thrilled at the money we're saving now that I don't have to buy an international plane ticket in this economy.  If it's mushy peas you're looking for; you've come to the right place! If  you can do without; hit Rosie McCaffrey's for the best fish and chips in town with the ambience of an international pub.,mM4JGpza3KkegHYUN7T79w,Food was super tasty; especially cus they don't use MSG. I would come here every week for lunch if I could. This is a place I would have to stop in when I'm on this side of town. I love how all the employees are super nice & friendly. Prices were decent and not over priced like other places are. This place is a must try or else ur just missing out.,mM4JGpza3KkegHYUN7T79w,I have never in my life had such a delicious meal!  Fantastic new menu; great prices and now open on Sunday!  Absolutely wonderful!,mM4JGpza3KkegHYUN7T79w,"I stopped in once for a quick bite of cheap sushi.   This is a converted fast food place of some kind in a strip shopping center. Counter service; lots of seating; and unfortunately a horrid stench.

The odor gets worse when you go into the raised dining area.  The 2 stars instead of 3 is for the horrid stench.  Anyway... There were only 2 customers. The guy at the counter was nice.

The problem is the rolls are cut and then the pieces are layed flat in a circle smooshed together in a small plastic food-service clear containier. The result is they don't come out in whole pieces.

Really close to my house so I'll walk over every so often. I've had the orange chicken (bit spicy for my taste but I'm weak to heat haha); the bento is great. Great price for what you get. Just today I had the chicken katsu and its great! Will definitely keep going.,mM4JGpza3KkegHYUN7T79w,"Who would know this little place ever existed?!  It is so eloquently hidden in the corner of strip mall that has gone to shit.  Being the person that I am; I decided to try this place out (why does it seem like I am always reviewing Asian Cuisine?  This is beyond me).  What a pleasant surprise!  To start; my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE thing about this place is the guy behind the counter; who I am guessing is the owner.  I think he just may be the reason I continue to come back.  Usually; we place orders over the phone for take-out; and I love to hear his familiar and peculiar voice on the other end; repeating my order back to me.  It's as if he smiles ALL the time!  I do not think I have ever seen this guy in a bad mood; not once!  On to the food; pricing; blah blah blah.  JK.  For the price range; this food is excellent.  I am a personal fan of the gyoza; passion iced tea; and your basic (and not so professional in terms of the \sushi\"" world) Alaskan roll and California roll.  They are very affordable and generally taste amazing.  For the balla on a budget: go with the Bento dish.  It has EVERYTHING you could ever ask for in a meal: teriyaki chicken over steamed veggies and rice; edamame; california rolls; eggroll; spicy beef over salad (which by the way has an amazing sauce).  I can't quite remember if anything else comes with it.  It is only $6.25!!!  I could not even finish the whole meal for lunch on my own.  Other items of interest: if you get your meal to go; be sure to ask for the red spiced pepper seasoning salt.  I think I sprinkle this on everything I get from there.  If you eat inside; they have them at the tables.  Which; speaking of the inside; it is a little odd.  They have random poles near the cash register...ODD.  I definitely recommend this place to anyone.  I have not tried much of the other food; but from what my friends and co-workers say; it has been delicious every time (especially the Kalbi steak).""",mM4JGpza3KkegHYUN7T79w,Love going here for the Bento.

This place was sold to new owners.  The prices have almost doubled; the meat is very fatty and no longer has good flavor.  To top it off the staff make it awkward asking why I don't go there very often.  I won't be back.,mM4JGpza3KkegHYUN7T79w,I love korean food but I love cheap; delicious korean food even more. They have variuos rice bowls on the menu and some platter options I haven't tried yet.   The bolgogi bowl is very tasty and with the yelp check in offers we also got 2 free refreshing iced green teas.   The place is clean and has a back/side area with more seating. I still have to go and check out their other bowls and happy hour; so there will definitely be an update.,mM4JGpza3KkegHYUN7T79w,I was craving some Asian food for lunch the other day so I searched Yelp to find a place to grab some food. Ichi Bowl had lots of great reviews and wasn't too far from my office so I decided to to give it a whirl. I am not a big fan of terriyaki; so I usually don't frequent places like this; but when I saw that they had Bulgogi on the menu; I just had to check it out!   I became obsessed with Bulgogi a couple of summer's ago at place in Coronado; CA; and have been on a mission to find something comparable here. I know that there are a few Korean BBQ places around town; but I am never near them around a meal time.   Ichi Bowl is in a random center on 19th Ave. & Camelback; but is very clean inside. And the prices are really cheap! I got the Bulgogi Combo which came with my choice of side (I chose pot stickers) and a beverage for around $7!   I got my food to go; but they do have a lot of seating for dining in. Upon first bite; I was so happy; the Bulgogi was so good; and so tender! You never know when dealing with these fast-casual places about quality; but the meat was top-notch with a delicious flavor. The pot stickers were average; but they were not supposed to be the main event anyway.

Setting is comfortable and clean.  I had California and Salmon sushi rolls.  They procured these dishes fairly fast; with a bit of wasabi and ginger; and I had no complaints about the sushi; it was good.  I've had my fair share of sushi; from buffets to RA sushi to pricy restaurants in NY.  I'd say the sushi is great for the price; it is somewhere in between the RA sushi and really pricy places.  I also had Orange chicken and rice.  Same as the sushi; great for the price.

The pizza was good (even without the basil) and the price seemed reasonable. The people working there however could use some help but management made up for it by reaching out.,lp-J_cO5owuMzGJqdn3PNg,"I loved the concept of this place! The red sauce was not my favorite; but the white sauce was delicious! You can get a mini pizza for around $5 with as many toppings as you want!

I had never been here before and she did not seem willing to waste her time answering questions. The first thing she says to me is \red sauce and cheese?\"" I did not know what I wanted at that point; so I asked her if I could look first. She said \""okay; but you need to pick a sauce.\"" Yes; I know. She seemed to be in a hurry and there was nobody even behind me. Rude! They guy at the register was more patient and friendly.

The \design your own\"" pizza craze is hot in Phoenix and this chain; although being the third entry in the field; are gonna make a race of it.  You get an 11 inch pizza for only $7.47 with as many or few toppings of your choice for one low price!  Or; if you prefer just a cheese pizza; ask for the \""maddy\"" for only $5.97.  They even have a \""mini\"" size for those with smaller appetites.  After selecting the size of your crust (and yes; they do have gluten-free available); you have your option of several toppings; including a rich tomato sauce; BBQ; and others.  As much as I wanted to stay traditional; the pesto sauce was calling my name (and I highly recommend it).  Your choice of toppings are extensive; and of high quality from the fresh meat to the colorful and vibrant vegetables.  Even the fresh herbs appeared to be freshly chopped.  In addition to the normal toppings; this place has a few I have not see elsewhere; like Asiago cheese; pepperoncini; fresh chopped rosemary and even a balsamic fig glaze to top it off.  The pizzas are cooked in a brick oven (not a conveyor belt like one of the other places) and come out fresh; hot and crisp in just a couple of minutes.  I made short work of the my Pesto and Veggie pizza; and will be back to expand my creativity and satisfy my hunger very soon....  They also have \""design your own\"" salads; garlic strips; and for desserts; cinnamon strips and sweet tarts.  Although you may have to skip the dessert if you decide to indulge yourself with one of their very tasty milkshakes.  One more thing before I go.  I have to mention the to-go boxes that are actually two separate pieces; which I found a bit odd at first; until I realized it was a clever and convenient way to share (if you can).  P.S. Extra kudos for having Angry Orchard Cider!""",lp-J_cO5owuMzGJqdn3PNg,From the moment I walked in; their set-up looked a lot like Subway subs (adding toppings down the line as you please). So for that reason; I wasn't expecting high hopes on quality; taste; or both.   After my first order today; pizza is really delicious. You can either order custom pizzas that are already pre-made with Mod suggestions listed on the side wall with ingredients; or you can make yours custom right there on the spot. All the decisions and the wait time for the pizza to cook; took about 10min. They also have glass bottles of Fanta & Coca-Cola (real Mexican style) which I loved! All pizzas are thin crust; and I really wish I would have ordered a mini size. The next level up is the Mod size; and I could barely eat 3 out of the 4 slices. Keep in mind I'm a 30yr old 200 lbs 6 foot tall guy. I had my pizza with extra red sauce; mozzarella cheese; gorgonzola cheese; chicken; pepperoni; and salami. The price including the glass coca-cola bottle was $10.89. I know with fluctuations; prices are increasing; although I still feel it's a bit much; but again perhaps the Mod size was too big. I almost want to give it 5 stars.,lp-J_cO5owuMzGJqdn3PNg,MOD Pizza is absolutely incredible!! I am now boycotting all other pizza establishments until they step up their game. I have visited MOD at least ten times since they opened near Metrocenter!! Where else can you get unlimited toppings with your choice of sauces for the same price every time? No coupons needed!! The thin crust cooked inside their magical oven is always right..the toppings are fresh and their sauce options keep me trying something new. The best part about MOD so far is the staff!! It is a good feeling to be served by happy people! They are attentive to their customers and make you feel welcome!! Keep up the great work MOD!! Until we meet again..probably tomorrow  Tim P,YSOaPUm5EORusVSPB6_Zag,I've gone to Whataburger since I was a kid and not a whole lot has seemed to change. I enjoy their burgers much more then McDonald's; Wendy's and Burger King! I wouldn't say it's my favorite burger place; but it's decent and a reasonable price.,ikcyah81MTF4ZzOivmPitw,I like this location because they always get my order right and if I park and order they are usually really quick. The drive-through tends to take a little bit longer so I always just park instead. I try to come during their happy hour between 2-4 to get half price drinks. I always order a cherry limeade with easy ice. Most places will throw a ton of ice in even if you ask for easy ice but this place doesn't!,ikcyah81MTF4ZzOivmPitw,"i wish we had sonic in hawaii! i love this place! and this place is in my boyfriends sisters backyard of her old house! we always have to stop here everyday of our vacation in arizona! even if its \cold\"". cold to me because its always 80 degrees in hawaii! but the slush's are sooo cheap and gooood. Ooh i must stop talking because i'm having withdrawls. :(""",WjT_DJivd3I98FxDgEZpTQ,The first time I ate the fries; I hated it. But then; I got used to them. Now; they taste really good! I eat at In-N-Out Burger so much. Food is usually healthier. It's relatively cheap. And Service is pretty good if the employees are competent.  I eat pretty healthy and I eat a lot. The best thing about this place is you can eat a lot in a healthy way for cheap. So just protein style hamburger (the custom order where they replace the bread with lettuce). Then just add extra onion; extra tomatoes and extra pickles for free. That's like a salad in itself. And for how much? $2.11 with tax. Not bad. ;)  If you really want to pig out; then order the animal style fries. It's not healthy. It has cheese and dressing and whatever they put in there. Or a 4x4 and some fries and shake. It's good. Just not healthy. But I love this place!,WjT_DJivd3I98FxDgEZpTQ,This was the first time I have ever been to a(n) in and out. Fast friendly service. Reasonable prices. Best burger I have gotten from a non mom and pop shop.  This in and out is by the fiesta mall; more off of alma school than southern.  Not a long wait in the drive thru either.. I will definitely go back!,WjT_DJivd3I98FxDgEZpTQ,Fresh; reminds me of Johnny Rockets.  Nothing spectacular but definitely good food for low prices.,WjT_DJivd3I98FxDgEZpTQ,Best burger around; but then I am favoritist to this place for a reason. Pricewise; they are decent and you actually get a combo; as opposed to Smashburger and Five Guys where their items are ala carte; hence you spend more money.   I am not a fan of cheese on hamburgers (yes; I know...I am WEIRD); therefore I order the #3 combo. Once in a while; I will either get the burger or the fries done Animal Style. Sometimes I will get a Strawberry Shake instead of a soda too. Their shakes are really good and hit the spot when it comes to sweetness for me. Usually it's the ice cold Diet Coke that lures me though. The only drawback for me is that they don't have Coke Zero. Coke Zero is my absolute drink of drinks and if it isn't offered; I resort to Diet Coke or once in a very blue moon; regular Coke or Dr. Pepper.  The service is pretty good although if it's super busy there may be a bit of a wait; but well worth it by the time you get your meal.,WjT_DJivd3I98FxDgEZpTQ,Fast service.  Good food.  Great milkshakes.  Unbeatable prices.,WjT_DJivd3I98FxDgEZpTQ,Like every other middle of the road In-N-Out burger joint I've ever been to--this one was full of all the same things: way too long of a wait; a simple and perfectly satisfactory burger; and some of the nicest dang kids running the place.  I was sent on an errand from someone else; which I don't mind. Sure; I'll pick you up a burger. What I didn't love; was the huge wait. I opted not to get in the drive-thru with 15+ cars ahead of me; and instead went in. I got my order in okay; but still sat there for the better part of a half hour to wait for two burgers and a shake.  Price isn't bad; but there are at least a dozen other places I'd go before In-N-Out that are more interesting. But hey brah; if it reminds you of your childhood; then go right ahead.,ZlvVCqFKTMK4rBkTQzVBpA,The subs were a little more money than Subway but worth the price.    This place is in a new urban development that looks great. However; this restaurant is a bit noisy and the staff had to yell to get my order (I personally don't like getting yelled at before I eat... I need soft; calm voices).  WHAT DO YOU WANT TO ORDER!!! I'll take a soft and calm sub please.   The food was great; the bread was my favorite because it was fresh and very soft (fluffy clouds from heaven); I'll be back.,ZlvVCqFKTMK4rBkTQzVBpA,I ordered the Caesar Chicken wrap expecting a Caesar type salad in a wrap; what I got was diced chicken with iceberge lettuce and very little Caesar dressing; no parmasean cheese; no romaine or other greens or veggies; just iceberg lettuce. Very pricey for this simple wrap; close to 8 bucks. My daughter ordered a burger & fries from the burger place two doors down; it was a much better choice.  I've never tried their subs; so I can't rate the subs.,ZlvVCqFKTMK4rBkTQzVBpA,What can I say? I am really impressed by their business; last week we got two regular subs; when we got home we noticed that it seemed to be lacking in meat and the cheese was non-existent on one and paper thin on the other. The subs were still good; but it was disappointing and I sent my concern off to Jersey Mike's. Within a couple of hours the manager of the location I had this experience called me.  She offered to treat my family to a sub dinner for our trouble. That is obvious commitment to quality service. The subs were fantastic this time. Turns out they were actually having issues with the slicer the day I went.   They will get my business again; their subs are tasty; with quality ingredients; and they are committed to customer service. Yes their prices are a bit higher then a place like subway; but you do get what you pay for!,ZlvVCqFKTMK4rBkTQzVBpA,What can I say?  The sandwiches are incredible!  A friend told me about this chain and it's now my favorite place for a great sub.  Great taste; friendly staff and...free cookies!  A little on the expensive side but well worth it,kcBHEBHnTx9ySJwOdaSgPA,"I was told about this place by some friends from Wisconsin and so decided to stop by when out in AZ recently.  They have an extensive menu and so it took me a few minutes to decide to try their current burger promotion the \pub burger\"" with a side of cheese curds.  I knew I would not be able to eat any of their custard on this trip though.  The burger came in an onion bun; with fried onions; I think blue cheese crumbles and A1 sauce.  It was tasty enough & well cooked; but really all of the flavors seemed to merge into each other - nothing stood out.  The cheese curds were well cooked (not greasy at all); but were really lacking seasoning (I sound like a judge on Chopped).  Overall it was tasty (and resonably priced) enough that I would stop by again and try out some other items - and try and make it to dessert.""",kcBHEBHnTx9ySJwOdaSgPA,This culvers in Casa Grande brings some much needed variety to the slim dining choices of our little town.

My family has tried a lot of their menu and except for the Walleye; we haven't been disappointed.   The only thing holding this place back is the high cost of the food. Going to Culvers is usually a treat for us and we know that the bill will be higher than most fast food places that we frequent. However; the high quality of the food means that you definitely get what you pay for. I just think that paying 5 or 6 bucks for 4 chicken tenders is kind of nuts.   This location has also become the hangout for every elderly person in Casa Grande...I swear. Drive by the outside fireplace area around 7 or 8 PM on a weeknight and you'll see for yourselves.

Always a good time there; even drive through.Hot and fresh chicken. And they have crinkle fries!!!!,2s5tyNvj6-eEks5cNFZQMg,Marginally decent chicken strips for marginally decent prices. The chicken was relatively moist but a little tough; the Cane's sauce was definitely not boss in my book (very little flavor other than sweet) and the fries were lukewarm and soggy. As others have mentioned; the drive-thru is engineered poorly with a payment window right as you turn the corner; leading to long lines. If there were other sauce options and better fries it'd be a place re-visiting.,2s5tyNvj6-eEks5cNFZQMg,Like it says; Yay! I'm a fan. These are some good chicken strips. The Texas toast is really good too. Plus the fries and never forget the Cane's sauce. The sause works so well with the chicken. I have heard of this place for a while but had never tried it. Mostly because I wasn't near any locations. I llike this one because it is close to school. Works out just right to run over on break and grab some chicken strips. I have only been through the drive thru so I don't know how the inside of the restaurant looks but through the windows it looks very nice and clean. The employees are always very nice and seem like they genuinely like working there. The drive thru moves pretty good. They only have one thing on the menu so it is pretty easy. You just have to decide how many strips you want. Every box comes with fries; Texas toast and of course the yummy sause. You can also get coleslaw in some of the boxes. I have yet to try that. The prices are pretty good too. No more than other fast food places. I am a fan and I will continue to come here on break. The chicken is very tender and juicy. It just falls apart when you bit into it. So good. Winner winner chicken dinner! I had to say it.,2s5tyNvj6-eEks5cNFZQMg,This place does one thing good and that is chicken strips!  I do not think they'll mind me saying this.  Prices are very reasonable.  The strips are amazing for fast food!  I've been to their other locations and this store on their second or third day.  Raising Cain's has some impressive quality standards in-place.  Every location I go to I am always served juicy chicken strips and the staff are trained well to assure that you will have excellent customer service.  I'm going on a limb here and am declaring these chicken strips the best fast food has to offer.,2s5tyNvj6-eEks5cNFZQMg,"Wow ia that drive thru packed after 5 p.m.!  It was way faster for me to just get off of my car and order inside. I got my order extremely fast. I even got out sooner than some of the cars that were at the the drive thru.    It was my husnand and my first time trying out this restaurant. We wanted to try it after my brother raved of it being the best. I got the 6 piece chicken fingers; it comes with: fries; Cole slaw; a piece of toast;  and cane sauce.  I thought it was a little in the pricey side. I didn't really enjoy the chicken with their sauce. I ate mine with the Louisiana hot sauce they have at the restaurant.

Yoshi's is an easy; fast; and fairly decent alternative to panda or KytBwl; i'll be back soon most likely.""",L19_1cG2ALVjdBQ456h26A,I would say it is comparable to Kyoto Bowl.  This particular location has a drive-thru window.  The menu is pretty basic; nothing too special.  Low price for a quick; fast-food lunch.  The exterior is kind of dingy; can't elaborate on the inside.  3-star for a Fast-Food Japanese bowl place.,L19_1cG2ALVjdBQ456h26A,Not sure why everyone is so harsh about this place.  You have to set appropriate expectations when visiting a place like this.  The restaurant was dated; but clean; the staff was super friendly and quite helpful and the food was reasonably priced and pretty tasty.  We sat outside with our furry friend and enjoyed ourselves for a quick bite to eat when we didn't feel like cooking.,L19_1cG2ALVjdBQ456h26A,I wasn't to impressed by the building but the location was convenient and the other location was not at the moment. I was the only customer in this big place! I had the chicken Yakasoba. It was all thigh meat. It was okay. There was a healthy percentage of fresh vegetables in the dish to make it a balanced meal. The cost was comparable to having a burger meal but a nice change. It's still not the noodle oasis I was seeking. I have had better Yakasoba but I'll return at least once to try the Teriyaki at some point and the other location.,L19_1cG2ALVjdBQ456h26A,"Repulsive. It's plain white rice with Teriyaki sauce and some disgusting bits of chicken. I made the mistake of not ordering the bowl \white meat only\"" and ended up with a bowl of fat; gristle; skin; cartilage; and odd-tasting bits that I couldn't identify. This is a $6 bowl of disgusting crap. I'm told that the \""white meat only\"" option is important. I don't care. Nobody should serve that; ever.   If you want a decent teriyaki bowl that won't make you want to vomit; go to Costco and get their frozen bowls. I can't remember the brand; but it's got veggies; delicious white meat (with a lot of flavor); rice; and sauce. It comes out to about $1.30 per bowl.   I'm eager to finish this review so that I can stop thinking about that disgusting bowl. So that's all.""",L19_1cG2ALVjdBQ456h26A,This place has been a favorite of mine ever since I was a youngster. I have always known that when I'm in the mood for some cheap Chinese food that tastes magnificent; this is my spot. If you're expecting a world-class dining experience; you should probably look elsewhere... but if you're looking for a world class take-out experience; you've hit the jackpot!! *cha-ching*,L19_1cG2ALVjdBQ456h26A,It's basically Asian fast food - and the quality of the food is pretty good for that standard. It's priced right as well. The food is ready; well; fast; since it is fast food. The inside; however; is the area that needs improvement. You can tell there's been some wear and tear to the building and the booths.,L19_1cG2ALVjdBQ456h26A,Dear Yoshi's.  You and I go way way back.  Remember that one time I ordered Combo #2 (Teriyaki chicken)?  Oh yeah I mean that was about 500 times.  Remember that time the girl behind the counter was puzzling over my request for some Gomasho?  Oh I meant the 500 times (it's ok; eventually she figures out what I'm asking for).  Remember that time Kirk and I saw a cockroach hanging out near the bathrooms?  It really happened!  But only one time did I see it.  Don't get defensive now; Yoshi's; but please take care of that problem if you haven't already.  It's ok; we will still do business together---especially if you keep your prices moderate.  I'll still order Dragon chicken.  I'll still brave your parking lot; fending off the odd transient here and there.  It's nice to know you'll always be there for some decent japanese style food at a moderate price.,L19_1cG2ALVjdBQ456h26A,Pretty darn good teriyaki bowls .. and at a cheap price !! Miso soup was 99 cents and pretty good with added soy sauce .. I will be back to try other items ...  2$ happy hour chicken bowls 3-5 pm!! Cant beat that !!!,L19_1cG2ALVjdBQ456h26A,Pretty darn good teriyaki bowls .. and at a cheap price !! Miso soup was 99 cents and pretty good with added soy sauce ..

This place looked dive-ish; but some of the best dishes come from places that look just like this. We went through the drive-thru around 8pm last Wednesday. The inside looked closed as the chairs were all stacked on the tables; but the drive-thru was buzzing.   My friend and I both got the Yakisoba noodle bowl with chicken. I also ordered an order of Gyoza. Both bowls and Gyoza came to $11.00 with tax. Pretty decent prices I thought.   We got back to my house; opened up the white wine; and camped out on the couch with our dinners. The sauce was pretty good- kind of a citrus soy. The noodles were good; even if average. Veggies and chicken were okay too. I guess the whole bowl was just okay. I was really craving the noodles and it shouldn't be hard to make good noodles at a Noodle place. The Gyoza were alright too- kind of crunchy around the edges. The sauce served with them were good though.   All in all; not my dream dinner; but just okay. Would probably drive-thru again if I was in the area and didn't feel like cooking that night.,iPxUYvC8tgt5rBr-IZlSeg,I love Luu's! Think of it as an authentic yokohama rice bowl. The ingredients are really fresh; and the price is beyond reasonable. The service is always quick and friendly. Oh and they don't skimp on the portion size or sauce; like some other places. Go try it!!!,iPxUYvC8tgt5rBr-IZlSeg,Me and my family have had their Teriyaki Chicken Bowl countless times. It's always good and at a reasonable price.  We usually get it to go; so I don't know the dine-in experience; but I definitely would recommend this place.,iPxUYvC8tgt5rBr-IZlSeg,I love this place. The prices are more than fair and the food is excellent for fast food. It is true; the woman who works the drive thru is extremely nice and friendly and she's always smiling. I like going here often. I'm never disappointed.,iPxUYvC8tgt5rBr-IZlSeg,We just moved into the area and found this place driving around. It is indeed the best quick Japanese bowls we've ever had. You can tell that they don't get the sauces out of a can like most places. The chicken was quite well done; seared and juicy at the same time. I'd also add that the vegetables were about as perfectly cooked as I've ever had--each one seemed separately steamed to ensure it all came out the right way. Aside from that; I don't believe I've ever had a crab puff that actually tasted of crab at all at comparatively priced places. We will definitely be going back; I can't wait until my mom comes up to visit because I've got a delight for her.,iPxUYvC8tgt5rBr-IZlSeg,My all time favorite Phoenix fast food restaurant. I have been coming here for almost 3 years and they have consistently good food; and excellent customer service. Christy; the gal at the drive through window; is the nicest; most friendly person I have encountered at a restaurant here in Phoenix.   I usually order the ginger chicken bowl with no rice and extra veggies. All the veggies are fresh; never frozen (you can see the whole carrots and fresh broccoli and cabbage from the window); and they are steamed to crunchy perfection. The ginger sauce is great; the portions are HUGE; and the prices are terrific. The crab puffs are full of crab (I find it strange at other restaurants crab puffs are on the menu; but don't actually have any crab in them); and are an excellent price at 6/$2.50. The spicy chicken wings and chicken satay are also delicious.  Luu's Chicken bowl has great food; great prices; and the best customer service in Phoenix!,iPxUYvC8tgt5rBr-IZlSeg,Good priced; but not the best if one is carb conscious,iPxUYvC8tgt5rBr-IZlSeg,Excellent; cheap and friendly!!!!  I love this place.Have been going here for a few years.  Not much to look at; but clean; delicious and amazingly cheap!   I have had many of the dishes and they are all great. They don't drench the food in sauce. There are warmers at the condiment area that have sauces. The egg rolls are large and crispy. They have pickled ginger at the condiment counter ( I could eat it by the bucket- full!). If you get food to go; they put the sauce in a container so the food does not get soggy and you can have as much or as little sauce as you desire. The veges are freshly cooked and still have texture. Everything seems to be freshly prepared.   Delicious!!!,iPxUYvC8tgt5rBr-IZlSeg,Pork bowl; chicken bowl; crab puffs. Absolutely delicious!   Quality ingredients; super fresh and tasty side sauces. Honestly I have never had drive through Japanese this good. The owners are awesome and tonight they are staying open late to accommodate my order.  Fast; friendly and fresh. It doesn't get much better at this price and convenience.,iPxUYvC8tgt5rBr-IZlSeg,Great fresh food Great people Great price... support your local businesses!!!,iPxUYvC8tgt5rBr-IZlSeg,Great authentic Japanese fast food at great prices. Fast friendly service. I got the chicken teriyaki and yakisoba. It was very tasty at a great price and they give a good portion. I would definitely recommend going here if you want authentic cheap Japanese food.,iPxUYvC8tgt5rBr-IZlSeg,Great authentic Japanese fast food at great prices. Fast friendly service. I got the chicken teriyaki and yakisoba. It was very tasty at a great price and they give a good portion. I would definitely recommend going here if you want authentic cheap Japanese food.,iPxUYvC8tgt5rBr-IZlSeg,Really good inexpensive food and friendly owners!  I come here at least once a week.  Their hot sauce goes great with their chicken egg rolls!,iPxUYvC8tgt5rBr-IZlSeg,I came here after finding it on yelp. Their food is very fresh; with the chicken carefully laid across the vegetables and rice with sauce on top. The presentation is really lovely for a fast food-ish place. In addition; the staff was super friendly. I told them it was my first time dining there; and they advised me to order the ginger chicken bowl; which I loved. I also ordered the crab puffs; after seeing so many positive reviews. The crab puffs were not all cream cheese like at other places; they were filled with crab and had some green onions; too. Be careful if you order these- they make them fresh for each order and they are HOT when they first come out! I dipped them in both the sweet and sour and the hot sauce that can be found at the sauce bar.  I wish I had gotten brown rice; but now I know for next time. I recommend this place if you are looking for a quick; cheap; asian fix in the area.,iPxUYvC8tgt5rBr-IZlSeg,"I just moved to Portland and you'd think I would be able to find something comparable to Luu's; but no such luck. I miss it already! The owners are sooooo nice; I would eat here at least twice a month for the three years I lived off Cactus. I think the only thing they don't make in-house is their wonton wrappers. Seriously: house-made sweet and sour? I've eaten so much Japanese/Chinese food and never once been to a place that makes virtually everything from scratch. I once went there and the wife asked if I wanted some sweet and sour with my eggroll. Even though it's delicious (ie not corn syrup with red food coloring); I told her I preferred Chinese hot mustard. I think about 3 months went by; I ordered my go-to of a teriyaki chicken bowl with an egg roll; and she says \Oh! I remembered you liked the hot mustard so I made some for you!\"" The mustard wasn't that great; I think she put soy sauce in it; but the gesture alone was awesome.  Highlights: * chicken is always seasoned and cooked to perfection with yummy caramelization from the flattop * crab puffs used to have real crab in them; last time I went it was imitation; but still some of the best I've had. They actually season the filling so it doesn't just taste like a ball of cream cheese. * perfectly steamed veggies! They definitely could use some salt; but they were never mushy or old tasting...always fresh and delicious! * yakisoba is some of the best I've had: not drowning in sauce; lovingly sprinkled with green onions and sesame seeds. * their tofu nuggets were probably the biggest surprise of all; they must make them in house. I would order those regularly and I'm not a vegetarian.  * they will customize your order without batting an eyelash: tofu nuggets instead of chicken? All veggies instead of rice in the teriyaki bowl? White meat only? Brown rice? You got it!  Portland is supposed to be this foodie Mecca; I went to a \""House of Teriyaki\"" that had 4 1/2 star reviews and it was disgusting. In fact; it was their $8; no-better-than-a-frozen entr_e chicken yakisoba that inspired me to write this review because I realized how much I miss Luu's already. For $8 at Luu's I could've had some of the most delicious chicken yakisoba ever and two eggrolls (FRESHLY fried and using quality filling). So; do yourself a favor and stop by here if you're in the area while I continue my search for a place near me up here that is fast; friendly; CHEAP; and has standards beyond a school cafeteria.""",iPxUYvC8tgt5rBr-IZlSeg,Excellent teriyaki chicken.  Great price.  Friendly staff.,iPxUYvC8tgt5rBr-IZlSeg,A decent place to get a decent rice bowl. I wasn't overly impressed with the taste of the food. The teriyaki sauce had a very light flavor and the egg roll was greasy; probably due to being fried in oil below temperature. The price was good for what you get. We got our food to go; which was the right choice because the old Wendy's building this restaurant is in needs a good cleaning.,iPxUYvC8tgt5rBr-IZlSeg,BEST Japanese food in the valley!! hands down you will not be disappointed they have the best tasting sesame chicken & original sauce I've ever had.  This is a quaint place with friendly service; eat in or drive thru.  The staff is friendly; the atmosphere is comfortable and clean and to top it off the prices are the most reasonable in town too!!  Must try dishes; tempura shrimp; teriyaki chicken and sesame chicken.  This place ROCKS!!!,iPxUYvC8tgt5rBr-IZlSeg,Love the ginger salad dressing. Food is always nice and hot. Service is very friendly. I love that they have a drive thru for those post yard work dinners (you know; when you're all dirty and sweaty and don't want to offend anyone). Definitely a great alternative to the typical burger fast food drive thru. Good prices; too!,iPxUYvC8tgt5rBr-IZlSeg,What a great discovery!  Luu's Chicken Bowl is a current favorite for our family.  We had driven by the location several times without even noticing it was there; but I could not be more happy we stumbled across it.   For those of you who don't like to read a page long review; here are some of the things I love most about Luu's....  Homemade; amazingly delicious sauces Fresh; high quality ingredients Fast; friendly service Great prices and generous servings They have a drive through  These guys know how to pack a to-go sack! ...and last but not least.......the CRAB WONTONS!  Oh; you want to know more?  Well; let me elaborate a bit :)  Upon entering Luu's; I always know I will be greeted by a smiling friendly face and an immaculately clean dining area.  There is a white board near the register listing the daily specials (try the teriyaki chicken and yakisoba) and a small counter housing homemade condiments; plastic utensils and a soda fountain.  After I place my order; I always hear a fresh batch of wontons get dropped in the fryer as they prepare our chicken bowls.  After just a few minutes; my order is on the counter perfectly parceled with everything I could need; extra teriyaki sauce; hot sauce; sweet and sour; and if we get a ginger chicken bowl (another must try item) there is also extra ginger sauce.  There are napkins and utensils included in the bag; as well.  If you decide to go through the drive through; keep in mind that they fry the wontons and egg rolls to order so there will be a few minutes of waiting at the window if you order these items.  The crab wontons are the crabbiest I have had.  Ever. They are delish with a double dip into the sweet and sour and then the hot sauce.  Trust me; it will be the best $2.59 +tax you have spent in a long time   **For a nominal fee you can substitute white meat chicken and/or brown rice; both of which I highly recommend,iPxUYvC8tgt5rBr-IZlSeg,Great food! The price is right for a chicken bowl; just under $5 and for just under $6; you can get a combo with pork; chicken or beef. I recently ordered food for 6 people and it could have fed 8-10. Oh; and the crab puffs?? Really; really good and only $2.50 for a bag of 6. I would recommend this for take-out. The inside of the restaurant is kind of what you'd expect (tacky and hole-in-the-wallish).,iPxUYvC8tgt5rBr-IZlSeg,I love this place. Family owned and operated; they work their butts off providing 100% consistent; quality food at a great price. I usually get the #1; a chicken bowl and I add a chicken egg roll. All taste great and for less than $6.  The chicken bowl comes with fresh grilled chicken with rice; cabbage; carrots; and broccoli smothered but not drowned in their fabulous teriyaki sauce.  The egg roll is fresh; hot and crunchy. I love them!,iPxUYvC8tgt5rBr-IZlSeg,Cheap and quick. That was the best part about this place. I can't say it was the tastiest bowl I have ever had. I got the ginger chicken; and the sauce just was not very flavorful. I had a bite of my husband's teriyaki and we each liked each other's more. I did enjoy the eggeoll; and the peanut sauce was good. I do wonder what kind of grade the food safety inspectors would give the restaurant; though.,iPxUYvC8tgt5rBr-IZlSeg,They are wonderful people that cook healthy quick Chinese food at a very affordable price.,iPxUYvC8tgt5rBr-IZlSeg,This place is pretty good. Even though it is a fast food place; it doesn't taste like it. I couldn't believe how tender their steak was; and their miso soup was delicious. Everything is reasonably priced too. I will definitely be back!,iPxUYvC8tgt5rBr-IZlSeg,A nice inexpensive neighborhood place for a rice bowl.  We tried the ginger chicken and teriyaki chicken bowls - both were quite good and the sauce was provided generously.  We also ordered the crab puffs which were also tastey. Don't be turned away by the appearance of the building; we were happy we gave it a try.,iPxUYvC8tgt5rBr-IZlSeg,Crazy cheap and delicious food--the hot chicken wings are perfectly cooked and crispy. It's also local and family-run!,iPxUYvC8tgt5rBr-IZlSeg,not much to look at but wow great food at reasonable prices. the Yakisoba noodles were to die for. nice people too. will go back again and again.,iPxUYvC8tgt5rBr-IZlSeg,Not what you'd think from a hole-in-the-wall place. Great food; awesome customer service; amazing prices. Luu's stands out in a fast food environment with loads of competition who seemingly care only about your money. I've had several dishes here and they're always fast; fresh and delicious. I've been reluctant to give any restaurant 5 stars before; but Luu's is worthy of the rating. Great eats. Recommend the yakisoba with teriyaki chicken; or the teriyaki chicken bowl (served with sweet jasmine rice!),uFwC7N9APy8oTjhda3p9lw,I went to Yelp to find a good Chinese food delivery place and came upon this one.  The last one I used to go to must have changed owners or something because the food went from amazing to awful.  I'm so glad we found this one.  The prices are reasonable and the food was delicious.  I ordered the spicy thai chicken and it was awesome. It had lots of chicken and good quality chicken at that.  My boyfriend ordered the hunan spicy beef and again the beef was perfectly cooked.  We also ordered the pot stickers; and crab puffs and they didn't disappoint either.  The fried rice was not the best I ever had but it won't stop me from ordering there again.  This will be my go to place for Chinese from now on!  I don't know why anyone would give this place less than four stars.,uFwC7N9APy8oTjhda3p9lw,Fair.  Great lunch prices,uFwC7N9APy8oTjhda3p9lw,Moo shu pork is best I have had in years and wife loved the sweet and sour chicken.....I recommend the Asian cafe for good; quality take out at a good price!,uFwC7N9APy8oTjhda3p9lw,I've been going to this place for over 2 years and they have great food; prepared fast; and at great prices!  Try their Teriyaki Chicken; they use Chinese 5-spice; great ingredient!,uFwC7N9APy8oTjhda3p9lw,This place is probably one of my favorite lunch spots in there area besides getting some Chino action in my life. Food is all that you'd expect from an Americanized Asian joint. The price is the gem. The lunch specials are stellar. If you pay more than $7 you're ordering wrong.   The portions are plenty generous for the price. The place is clean; friendly; and fast. All things that I value very much during my limited lunch hour. I go 1-2 times a week; and have yet to be disappointed. Give it a go,uFwC7N9APy8oTjhda3p9lw,Fantastic food. Great prices. Nice locale.  Every time I go in; I always feel like they're making food special for me. Oh wait; they are !  I'm a picky eater; so I always deviate a little from the regular menu ingredients. I love that they can cook to suit my needs.  It proves difficult sometimes at other restaurants. But not at Asian Cafe.,uFwC7N9APy8oTjhda3p9lw,My favorite Chinese delivery. You get a ton of food and it's not to expensive! The employees are always friendly and smiling. Just a little hole in the wall place. My favorite part is they will sub tofu on any entree! They always quote delivery at 30-40 min and ALWAYS show up wayyyy earlier. My husband and I eat here at least once a month.,uFwC7N9APy8oTjhda3p9lw,okay; but not nearly as good as this batch of reviews makes it sounds.    kind of cheap; but a little bit greasy  plenty of choices nearby that will get  you better quality for the same $,uFwC7N9APy8oTjhda3p9lw,Dropped in for a quick lunch on my way to Home Depot. I wanted a quick light meal.   The place is clean and the lunch special is cheap. The service was great real friendly.   I had Sesame Chicken and asked them to spice it up a little. It was deep fried and served over white rice. The chicken was good and the rice was rice. LOL $3.69 for lunch and I am just starting to get hungry after 5 hours. NOT BAD.,uFwC7N9APy8oTjhda3p9lw,This place is great. The food is really cheap; and made fresh.  While the bowls at Panda Express are like $5; they're only $3.40 here; and it tastes better. Plus; you can customize the food for no additional charge (unless you add something). Also; THEY DELIVER.,uFwC7N9APy8oTjhda3p9lw,I love Asian Cafe!!!! I eat here all the time.

I enjoyed the people and the next door feel of the place!,uFwC7N9APy8oTjhda3p9lw,This place has great food at an affordable price. The shrimp lo mein was outstanding and the Thai spicy chicken was very flavorful; it had a good kick of spice without being overwhelming.,uFwC7N9APy8oTjhda3p9lw,I've been here several times and although the food is mostly pretty good; the man behind the counter is ALWAYS rude. No matter how polite we are to him; he never fails to roll his eyes at us when we ask for extra sweet and sour or hot mustard. He also rolls his eyes when we ask simple questions about the dishes we plan to order. He talks to us like we are stupid and always makes it clear that we are inconveniencing him. If they didn't have lunch specials at such a great price I probably wouldn't go back due to his bad attitude; but the food and prices are pretty good. My favorites are the beef and broccoli and the Thai spicy chicken. The egg roll would be one of the best I've had except they don't change their fryer oil often enough and anything deep fried has a nasty rancid oil flavor.,uFwC7N9APy8oTjhda3p9lw,Average.  Not bad or special. Reasonable prices,uFwC7N9APy8oTjhda3p9lw,Lunch special was great price. Under $7 with drink. I had the orange chicken lunch combo. The meal was super hot and quite tasty.

We were craving Asian food and decided to give Asian Cafe a try. We ordered; Mongolian beef; spicy Thai chicken; sesame chicken; and sweet and sour chicken. Each entree was accompanied by a scoop of fried rice; a scoop of noodles; an egg roll; a fortune cookie; and a soda. The egg roll was pretty standard fare; but had a nice ginger taste that was unique. The fried rice was quite bland. I am not an Asian noodle fan; so I did not try them. The chicken entrees were all good. All in all; the food was fine. It was very inexpensive ... $4.50 for the whole meal. I was not impressed; however;  with the styrofoam food boxes (dine-in meals  served that way); styrofoam cups and plastic forks and knives. I do not think I would return to or recommend the restaurant as there are many others to choose from in the area .,uFwC7N9APy8oTjhda3p9lw,By far the best place to get Chinese food! I love the beef and broccoli. Give the Asian cafe a try. Good prices. The people that own the place are very welcoming.,obkBJENTOXC3YpS_VWiPyw,The service at this restaurant is terrible.  They throw food at you like they are giving food to the homeless. :(   I called the manager to complain; and she said she will fix the problem.   The food are so expensive here.  The burrito is full of rice and very little of everything else.   Do you ever question what you put in your stomach for your meal??? They claim that they try to get organic food here; but I don't really know or we all don't know how hard they try (1% or 99% organic????).    It is better to go to a less expensive fast food place.,obkBJENTOXC3YpS_VWiPyw,Who doesn't like Chipotle? I get the bowl and have them put everything on it (minus guac; I'm cheap).  Yum. Nom nom nom nom...,obkBJENTOXC3YpS_VWiPyw,A few years ago; I would have given this location a 5 star review but it has gone downhill since then. They used to give discounts if you only got a few things in your burrito. They have continually raised prices while giving smaller portions. I'm pretty sure they use smaller spoons. And I get that they are a corporation and that the decisions aren't always up to them; but there is no denying the value has gone down hill. It's still good food; but not worth 9  dollars a person.,obkBJENTOXC3YpS_VWiPyw,So normally I'm a huge fan of Chipotle so it's with a heavy heart that I write this review.  This review is more about the service though than the food.  I typically go to this Chipotle after my workouts because I feel it is a very healthy alternative when I am to tired to cook.  Tonight though; I usually order a veggie bowl which normally gets guacamole on top; they ran out on the person right in front of me.  Instead of discounting the veggie bowl or offering me free chips; which I asked about; they told me no basically and have me some excuse about a point system.  I can't imagine those chips are anywhere in the same price range as the guacamole and they probably go stale if they don't sell them out that day; so why not make a customers day a little happier when you can.   This will probably; in  no way; affect me going back but as a new vegetarian I look forward to the guacamole on my veggie bowl.,obkBJENTOXC3YpS_VWiPyw,We've been here a number of times. The food is fairly tasty. The prices are reasonable and the portions fairly large. Two can easily split a burrito and leave feeling full. My rating is for the staff. They have little to no personality and a major attitude. Try asking for something extra and prepare for the major sighing and poor body language. They all act as if they wish they were somewhere else. My perception is not for any individual but for everyone I've dealt with here on every visit.,tONuJUMGL394lS3MM0UmzQ,The subs are small and just not worth the money!! Dont take the kids there!!; it will cost a bundle of money;.way too expensive and you dont get much!! I think its a criminal interprise!!,tONuJUMGL394lS3MM0UmzQ,The subs are small and just not worth the money!! Dont take the kids there!!; it will cost a bundle of money;.way too expensive and you dont get much!! I think its a criminal interprise!!,tONuJUMGL394lS3MM0UmzQ,"We love Firehouse Subs! This particular location is new and hopefully the staff will become friendlier after the newness wheres off!  Food was awesome and made correctly. I love the steak and cheese; but hold the mustard ;) Each of our sandwiches were correct; we ordered four different ones.  There was no \Welcome to Firehouse\"" when entering the door; this was disappointing; since it always made you feel welcomed when you entered.Maybe a Sunday night isn't the best night to come in; but it was around 6:00 so they shouldn't of been wanting to close it up.  The place was very clean; but I do not like people sweeping when I am trying to eat my dinner. I know call me CRAZY but I really do believe that NO ESTABLISHMENT should sweep when people are at a table eating. Dust goes everywhere even if you can't see it.  There was only 1 other family in there; very quiet. I found that odd compared to other Firehouse Subs; but being that they are new; I hope that will change.   Love the soda machine with all the options available!  My other problem is the cost. It's now over $8.00 for a combo; which I believe is very high. I can eat at a sit down restaurant and pay less than $35.00 and still have a quick but nice meal.""",tONuJUMGL394lS3MM0UmzQ,Do not visit this location.  Complete food violations.  A customer drive back to return a to go order stating there was an extra sandwich in the bag; the employee removed the sandwich and served it to another costumer.    Shut this place down.  I threw out my food and left,tONuJUMGL394lS3MM0UmzQ,I really liked Firehouse! They served me to my first mind-blowing Italian sub. Firehouse gives discounts to active duty military and also to firemen/search and rescue. I left the 5th star unchecked simply because the price is a bit higher than normal Phoenix sub shops. I plan on going back monthly at the very least!,tONuJUMGL394lS3MM0UmzQ,It just opened so it's very clean.  I'm not a big sub eater but my husband and son are so I went along and I must admit it was pretty darn good!  Had the pastramie; which if you are a pastramie  eater; that this is risky business in untried waters.  Nothing worse than tough stringy corned beef or pastramie.  This isn't.  It's wonderfully tender; warm and juicy.  Not to sure about putting lettuce and mayo on it (that's how it comes if you don't ask for different) but next time I will just tell them to leave it off.  My son told me I could do that. Thanks son. But I for sure will be going back.  It does seem a bit pricey but I guess everything is these days. Is $35.00 to much for 3 sandwhiches 3 soda's a 3 tiny bags of chips; maybe not.,tONuJUMGL394lS3MM0UmzQ,So not good that this is less than 2 minutes from my house! Really great sandwiches at fair prices. My favorite is the italian. I liked the meatball but I make better! They are always really fast with getting the sandwiches out and the people at the registers are all really nice. I love their soda machine. I feel like a kid in a candy store trying to pick my drink with all the fun buttons and options! Only complaint is they are not out and about cleaning the tables quickly. Twice I have asked for something to wipe one down to get a seat. No biggie; they are busy and I usually take it home anyways. I did go 3 times before they told me about the punch card as well but I have one now and will use it.,yyahaWDdm1Hes99IZkSJPg,I don't understand all the hoopla about this place.  The last time I ate here was probably 2005.  The burger and fries were average but I wouldn't say spectacular.  The prices are reasonable and the staff are nice but when I want to enjoy a great; fresh and non-microwave hamburger I always hit up Whataburger.  To each there own I guess :-),yyahaWDdm1Hes99IZkSJPg,"Is \California Cool\"" a brand? I think so; and I think In-N-Out personifies it better than any store in the mall selling overpriced clothing in Euro sizes.  Fresh ingredients including never frozen beef; and fries that are made after you order them. Pretty cheap pricing. Friendly service. Spotlessly clean. A secret menu adding intrigue to the ordinary.  So; what happens if you ask for your burger Gangnam Style?""",yyahaWDdm1Hes99IZkSJPg,"Is \California Cool\"" a brand?

So; what happens if you ask for your burger Gangnam Style?""",yyahaWDdm1Hes99IZkSJPg,Out of around 15 In-N-Out's I've been; this one has the best food and service.  In-N-Out consistently provides top service; prices; and food quality in the burger and fries fast food chain market.  In-N-Out seriously needs to review their parking/drive through development.  Half the locations I've been to have some kind of issue.  This In-N-Out is RIDICULOUSLY DIFFICULT TO ENTER/EXIT.  Once you're in the parking lot/drive though area it's ok.  If you're leaving In-N-Out; and planning to head west on Bell (or to the 101); it's almost impossible without a u-turn or separate lot turnaround in high volume traffic.    Despite the driving issues; THIS In-N-Out is SO GOOD I'VE BECOME A REGULAR (2-3 times a month).  I was not an In-N-Out regular before I visited this location.,yyahaWDdm1Hes99IZkSJPg,Double Double with frys to go please!!!  Great burgers and food; not just for the price but as an overall meal. If this is on one corner and there are three other fast food burger joints on each of the other corners; I am going here.  Fresh cut frys and grilled onions on my burger; yup...I am in.,yyahaWDdm1Hes99IZkSJPg,"Ok. So I found this place and was quite skeptical. Another freaking burger place? How great can it be?? But you will not be disappointed!   Their burgers taste amazing!! They're shakes are tasty AND cheap ($1.50). I recently moved away from here but I'm really missing it. I would really like to try their monster burger whenever I get around to coming back.   When you get something to go; keep in mind they dont have \to go\"" boxes; so your burger will be in a paper wrapping and thrown in the bag. Same goes for fries. I wish they had a little bit better packaging ideas.""",yyahaWDdm1Hes99IZkSJPg,The food and service here can not be matched; my only problem with this place is their parking lot.  It is poorly designed and can only be accessed on 83rd avenue.  If their parking lot connected to the rest of the shopping center it would allow for better flow of traffic.  Prices and quality of food though are an A+,yyahaWDdm1Hes99IZkSJPg,OK.  You either like or don't like In-N-Out; I'm not going to try to convert anyone.  I think they're a good burger; they're not expensive; and I love their fries.  I also like their corporate ethos of raising their own products and how they help teen employees with scholarships.  Very nice.  And this location is your typical In-N-Out; always busy at lunch; standard white & red decor; etc.  So why am I giving them two stars?  Because of their totally asinine parking configuration.  If you are approaching on Bell or on 83rd Ave southbound; you're screwed.  Your first opportunity to turn around has a sign that says No U Turns; though it's ignored regularly.  So you turn in to the parking lot; expecting to connect to it.  Your expectations are about to be dashed.  They don't connect.  The only way to turn in to the parking lot would be to be northbound on 83rd.  There is no reason why the lots cannot connect; and for that reason; I'm giving them two stars and don't plan on returning here.  I have more than enough frustration in my life; and there are plenty of In-N-Outs; and other places; that have much more accessible parking.  Maybe they'll fix it some day; but I won't hold my breath.,yyahaWDdm1Hes99IZkSJPg,"Yeah......I don't get it.  It's a burger joint.  I mean it wasn't bad but it was just OK.  I think I got caught up in all the \hoopla\"" about this place and was expecting more.  Granted the cost was on the money but the burger and the fries were kinda \""blah\"".  I guess the old \""you get what you pay for\"" adage holds true here.  I been here 3 times (twice because friends from out of town wanted to go there) and wasn't impressed any of the times.  To the East Coast people:  I will trade you ALL of the In-N-Out Burger restaurants for ONE White Castle.""",yyahaWDdm1Hes99IZkSJPg,This place is always a stop when i am out in AZ.  Loves it!!!!!!!!!! Great burger; great fries; not too expensive; usually pretty quick.  I only wish they had in-n-out where i live.   I like to stick  with the double double and fries.  My gf likes to get her fries well done.  Its a nice option if you like them extra crispy; but regular tastes fine to me.,JGTPb06Ix_v7uq3HADzq8w,Its a great place.. Just walking distance form the thunderbird business school . The good thing is- lot of meat at good price. The service is also very awesome. The attendants were very helpful and are present to suggest and guide you.,JGTPb06Ix_v7uq3HADzq8w,Chipotle is not particularly the most authentic Mexican place around...but with excellent meat; a nice staff; low prices and convenient location I somehow find myself enjoying one or two meals there per week.,JGTPb06Ix_v7uq3HADzq8w,This was the location where I fell inlove with Chipotle. This is the most authentic Mexican chained fast food restaurant I've been to. I've tried almost everything on their menu and its very tasty for such low price. They also offer quesdillas which is not on the menu which is pretty good.   Their homemade gucamole seals the deal. its d-e licious! its good with the burrito; taco; burrito bowl; or as a dip for the chips!   IM SO GLAD they have recently opened locations near san francisco!,JGTPb06Ix_v7uq3HADzq8w,I'm sort of torn between 3 and 4.  Yes; it is a really great tasting burrito and the ingredients are much better to start with  But it is also one of the more expensive fast food burritos.  I've probably been to this location at least a dozen times and all but twice I pretty much get the same thing. Today the weather was beautiful and my haircut across the street was finished early so I sat on the patio for lunch.,R2IWbpUgJQ3NRRjKQy6O_Q,Indistinguishable between other locations.    Good good; price and friendly staff.,R2IWbpUgJQ3NRRjKQy6O_Q,Dang- worlds strongest margarita here! Most people don't know they even serve Margs here. I always thought they were wine margs but the guy who made mine says they are made with actual tequila. I ordered 1 and I thought I got roofied it was so strong. Anyhoo- good service; good food; good prices and good chill location- not too many people at all.,_CIodPGuvPP2khYkDk1jKw,Authentic Mexican tacos (I consider myself a bit of a connoisseur) ... and you can't beat the prices.  Right outside of Charlies Night Club; off the light rail with easy access. Yum; yum; yummy.,_CIodPGuvPP2khYkDk1jKw,This is my 2nd time here and both times I was not disappointed. Get there early because the lines do get long but it's worth the wait. I got the carne asada tacos and mini quesedillas; total of 4 tacos and 2 minis at 8.00 is a great price. This fed both javier and I. They are not skimpy with the meat and it has lots of flavor. The red salsa also has a good kick to it. I will continue to go back.,_CIodPGuvPP2khYkDk1jKw,I was craving some tacos (San Diego withdrawal symptoms) and had this place bookmared.  It was on the way home so I stopped.  The line was pretty deep and took about 15 minutes before I placed my order.  I ordered 2 pollo tacos; 3 carne asada tacos; one mini carne asada quesadilla and one mini pollo quesadilla.  Total for all that food was only $9.00!   Its $1.00 per taco and $2.00 per quesadilla. Here is how they were................  Pollo Taco-  This was my favorite of the bunch.  They have great tortillas and they top them with grilled chicken; guacamole; cabbage and hot sauce.  The cabbage threw me for a loop at first but it actually worked with these kind of tacos.  These tacos are super duper small....2 biters.  For a buck; they are fine.  Carne Asada Taco-  Same prep as the pollo.  The carne asada was flavored decent.  My tacos did have some gristle and fat in them.  They were fair.....compared to some spots in SD; nowhere close; but for Phoenix; they were decent.  Quesadillas-  These were topped the same way as the tacos but cheese and another tortilla was added.  Next time; I might just get cheese/meat.  The cabbage made these quesadillas worse.  Weird texture issues lol.    Service was friendly enough.  Price was good but I was not blown away.  TONS of people were coming and going though so its pretty popular and may be the best Phoenix has to offer.  If so; Ill accept it but Ill continue to dream of SD taco shops!  That's about it.  Nothing super positive to say; and nothing negative to say.  It was A-OK!,_CIodPGuvPP2khYkDk1jKw,Best after hours choice in Phoenix! Really good authentic cheap Mexican food. Good horchata! Good salsa! Good food! The long lines at 2am are definitely worth it.,_CIodPGuvPP2khYkDk1jKw,This is one of the other taco place that hits me right at home. I mostly come here during the night time because its really one of the only taco places open late (please do not compare to Filibertos!!). Menu is pretty simple chicken or carne asada; awesome prices too! Also I love where they cook and cut the meat; it's like a food cart on steroids...HUGE and impressive. Out late and around the area don't miss out on this place.,_CIodPGuvPP2khYkDk1jKw,Great tacos and even better prices.  Only down side is the lines are always long bit it's worth the wait.,_CIodPGuvPP2khYkDk1jKw,"Oh wow I am super surprised this place only have a few reviews. This place is always packed with a line from it being so popular. CHARLIE\S TACO STAND!!  These are the BEST tacos I have had since I moved to Phoenix. I dont know how to explain how great they are. They meat is finely chopped up on top of a palm tree trunk which I am not sure if it give it a flavor to the meat but I think it does. The menu is simple only chicken and carne asada tacos for $1 (super cheap) and the have burritos and a few other items but the tacos I believe are the best!!!""",_CIodPGuvPP2khYkDk1jKw,Very good asada tacos which is not easy to find in Phoenix. Both quesadillas are also very good; the mini and the full-size. It's only a four star because of the limited menu choices. The pricing is about as cheap as your going to find.  This place delivers excellent flavor and a good price point. The service is quick and helpful. The employees make you feel welcome and at home even though it's outdoors.   If you are craving Mexico style street tacos this is about as close as you're going to get in the Phoenix area. If anybody knows a better taco stand please let me know.,_CIodPGuvPP2khYkDk1jKw,Very good asada tacos which is not easy to find in Phoenix.

The Asada taco and mini-quesadilla are both incredible.  Not sure why it took me so long to get over here...I live literally blocks away.,_CIodPGuvPP2khYkDk1jKw,You can't imagine how delighted I am to find such a place in Arizona! My friends and I have resorted to fast food late night meals after a night of going out and that's just depressing.   The truck is located right outside Charlie's gay bar on the corner of Camelback and Florence; right before you hit Florence. You will see the sign for Charlie's first so just pull into their parking lot. The club was bumpin that night so the lot was full but the taco stand had almost no line Sunday at 11pm. Even though there were security guards by the club and my friend was a guy; I still felt a little nervous because there were definitely some shady looking people hanging out nearby. So if you're a chick make sure to go with a group. Don't let this deter you from going though; as we sat and ate there were plenty of groups coming by (couples; college kids; high school kids) so I felt more at ease.   As for the food; I was craving  a hot dog but I obviously wanted the tacos. Solution= I got both (sorryimafatty). Skip on the hot dog unless you're really craving it; its just a grilled ball park dog and I prefer mine all beef. Came with a side of Doritos which I gave to my friend.   TACOS HOWEVER were delicious! I got mine with all the toppings; the red sauce they put on there is spicy! It burned but that roasted red chili pepper taste is so good. I got the pollo and asada.. both were good but I definitely preferred the flavor of the asada more. My friend got the Asada burrito and devoured it! Burrito had the same toppings as the tacos: red sauce; guac; cabbage and onions. Also ordered a Horchata which was meh: watered down; gritty; and not very sweet or cinnamon-y .   Prices are more than reasonable; service is very friendly and food is excellent! They're only open Thursday to Sunday nights; I will for sure be back. Maybe I'll check out the bar this time too ;),_CIodPGuvPP2khYkDk1jKw,BEST carne asada tacos in AZ!!! Being Hispanic and growing up w/ good Mexican food; I have yet to find a spot that serves up carne asada better than this! The menu is inexpensive and TOTALLY worth it!,_CIodPGuvPP2khYkDk1jKw,Best late night Mexican food in Phoenix.  Seems to mainly be family owned. Very eclectic mix for quality people watching as well. $1 tacos are great - men will need at least 4 but they are delicate & insanely delicious. Burritos only $4. The price & taste are unrivaled.,_CIodPGuvPP2khYkDk1jKw,Food: These both got a little messy to eat so ask for extra napkins!  - Taco asada - beef; cabbage; guacamole; salsa; and hot sauce over a mini flour tortilla ($1). Tasty and dirt cheap! - Quesadilla Pollo - chicken and cheese with cabbage; guacamole; salsa and hot sauce sandwiched between 2 mini flour tortillas ($2). Also; tasty and cheap!   Service: Fast and friendly. This food truck spot opens at 7:30; we got here at 7:38 and all the table were taken. We had to wait for people to leave so we can quickly grab their table. I'll definitely come back. A tasty meal for $4; I also ordered bottled water ($1).,_CIodPGuvPP2khYkDk1jKw,This was stop 3 on the taco tour last night with Jon and Amy H. This place is certainly the best deal for tacos in town at 1$ per taco ... the ambience... well; not so much. It's a semi permanent truck sort of situation with some picnic tables outside of a bar. The husband and I shared the pollo mini quesadilla (2$) and the carne taco. The taco was just ok... nothing terribly special; but good for 1$. The quesadilla was really good... very flavorful; and I usually don't love chicken at taco shops; but this was good. I would come back for that. We also had the horchata.... this was not so good... too watery and too much cinnamon.... I couldn't even really drink it. Anyway; I think this place is good for the price; but I wouldn't be rushing back here for a taco.,_CIodPGuvPP2khYkDk1jKw,This taqueria serves up some of the best street tacos ever; and definitely in town. Stopped here over the weekend with some friends who had been before. The prices most definitely can't be beat; I got 2 tacos; a mini carne asada quesadilla and water for $5. The carne asada was flavorful and the toppings just added to the flavors.   The location makes for some great people watching and the workers are friendly. If you're in the area it's a definite must-stop for some yummy Mexican favorites.,_CIodPGuvPP2khYkDk1jKw,I love Los Yaquis!! Their carne asada tacos are simply the best in Phoenix!! They are always packed!! The tacos are super cheap too!! They are open only from Thursday-Sunday!,_CIodPGuvPP2khYkDk1jKw,If I could give this place zero stars; I would. This is by far the worst Mexican food I've ever had. Firstly; the horchata is made from a mix. As a result of this; it is chalky. Secondly; the nachos have that fake nacho cheese and round yellow chips; not anything remotely authentic or Mexican. The only okay thing was the meat. This was more like a cheap meal you would get at a theater; completely overpriced and shitty. I can see why it has late hours; only drunk people would classify this as a good meal. Anyone who has been to a real; authentic Mexican restaurant should proceed with caution.,_CIodPGuvPP2khYkDk1jKw,If I could give this place zero stars; I would.

Given that it's set up outside of a bar; you would think it wasn't the best in the world; but they really are yummy.  It's actually set up much like a permanent food truck but they have ample picnic style seating.   This is the place to go if you want some post-clubbing snacks at a pretty reasonable price.  They even have an ordering window which is located in outside area in Charlies.,_CIodPGuvPP2khYkDk1jKw,Wasn't blown away as suggested by some reviews; but pretty good tacos for the cheap price.  But they are not the best I've ever had and the service is very slow. I didn't think the line was too long and was surprised to find myself still in line 15 minutes later. Disappointed to see only carne asada or chicken choices. The tacos were a great size for a late night snack. I found the mini quesadillas to be too salty; although it did have a nice crisp.  The salsa roja had a nice spicy kick.  The horchata was too creamy and sweet. I wouldn't go out of my way to come back. But if I were in the area and had the nighttime munchies; it'd be better than a 24 hr fast food joint. Just be ok with waiting up to 45 minutes for some tacos.,_CIodPGuvPP2khYkDk1jKw,Wasn't blown away as suggested by some reviews; but pretty good tacos for the cheap price.

As someone who doesn't really enjoy tacos; I was skeptical about coming here. However; after that first taco... All I wanted to do was come back; and I did -- the very next day. I love the taco asada! The meat is juicy and tender; with spice added from the salsa and slight crunchiness from the cabbage. And it's only $1! I like to ask for lime wedges to squeeze on my tacos to add a slight acidic taste. I also tried a quesadilla; but I felt like the taco was easier to eat (not so messy).   The horchata is also delicious and large; serving as perfect companion to those savory tacos with its sweet; slightly milky taste. And what a steal; 24 oz for only $2!   The line does get long sometimes; but it moves fairly quickly. Bear with it! The food is worth the wait.,DAIBZ-I6i5wEUsxEolzXBA,Very Yummy Spicy Cgicken Sandwich cole slaw was very tasty good service a little pricey but worth it!!,DAIBZ-I6i5wEUsxEolzXBA,"Yes; I know-5 stars for a fast food restaurant; but I swear; this place deserves it.  When I was a kid; it was always a treat to walk by the Chik-Fil-A in Metro Center and be lucky enough to get a sample of their delicious chicken; and would feel even luckier to have money in my pocket to buy a sandwich from here.  Well; my man had never eaten at this chain; and since we had a very long road trip home ahead of us; we decided to have an early lunch here on our way out of town.  This is not cheap fast food. It is high quality stuff-juicy chicken; fresh ingredients; nice fruit cup (including strawberries) for an alternative to fries. The cleanest bathroom I have ever seen; people coming to our table to offer up drink refills; asking if we were pleased with our meals; etc. One reason I like them is that they don't put mayo on their sandwiches!!!  This is a \Christian\"" business. Closed on Sundays; not sure of the politics; but interestingly enough; the only Bay Area location is in Fairfield...  A definite place to try as an alternative to all the regular fast food chains-and to know there is delicious; fresh and moderately healthy food....""",#NAME?,The five stars is because this is the BEST fast food burger joint in the USA.  The food is hot and fresh; the menu is small so it keeps things simple and dang if the burgers are mouthwatering delicious.  This is the best thing to come out of california next to fake boobs.  Parking is a pain; and there is usually a line (inside).  Avoid at all costs at lunchtime; it's PACKED; and that includes the drive-thru.  If you can't stand the line; there many alternatives within walking distance.  Oh; and get a milkshake!,#NAME?,Best fast food joint around for the price.  Forget about Ronald McDonald and The King.,plrLdKQvnyWlDvQ3kFSqwQ,We've passed by this place a dozen times; and I finally got to try it out when we had a family dinner at our house. I was craving gyros; so I called to ask how much a big platter of gyros was. The owner was extremely nice. Both he and the cook ensured that we had a great meal. They gave me directions for reheating (as I was needing the food for Sunday; but they were only open Saturday for pickup.) Everyone loved the gyro meat. He even put together salad and pitas to go with it. It was a great price too for feeding 10 people!!! We've gone back a few times. :-),plrLdKQvnyWlDvQ3kFSqwQ,Best Gyro's for the price.  For reference; I used to be a fan of Med Fresh Gyro's on Mill Ave but their prices have gone up and quality has gone down.      Don't remember the name of the cook. He's always been very friendly and makes the best gyro sandwiches for $4; can not beat that anywhere in town.  I think gyro places get their meat from the same distributor/brand (Kronos); but this place is fairly generous with their pieces of meat; always pretty fresh too.    My wife loves the Greek Salad with chicken;  like others have noted the chicken is marinated wonderfully and the lettuce is perfectly crisp each time she's had it  4-5 times now.,plrLdKQvnyWlDvQ3kFSqwQ,Great gyros; good lunch price!,plrLdKQvnyWlDvQ3kFSqwQ,Great food for a great price. Owner is very generous and a nice guy. Small space; I go for take out but worth the stop in for sure.,g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,Fast; friendly and super nice employees. Lines can always be long at In-n-Outs but on days like those at this particular location the employees definitely make the line go very quick and seem faster than it really is. Food is always amazing here. Easy location to find and of course they have very affordable prices.,g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,Yes I did it 5 Stars for a burger joint and without a bit of guilt.  This place rocks my wife makes me drive from our home on Shea and 130th Street to this location thats like 10 miles one way just for a burger.  Sometimes its fricken late as hell but I always deliver so I can get mine to if ya know what I mean.  Monster Style heck any style here is simply fantastic.  I love how they let you see into the kitchen.  Nothing to hide here not like the other joints.  This place is the pinnacle of clean from the parking lot to the kitchen.  The burgers are fresh the fries fresh cut right before your eyes.  In and Out is the best at what they do make delicious burgers and sell them to you at a price that makes you smile.  Get one; two maybe three its all good.  They are rapidly expanding and for good reason.  Please read this review and build one across the street from me.  Im sure that the Mayo Clinic will give you the land for free and Im sure I'll have to visit the Mayo in a couple months to have my arteries cleared so I can eat more of your delicious burgers.  Simply Fantastic.  A must on anyones Bucket List.,g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,"The best burgers of all chainburgers!  Fresh; juicy burgers at a ral low price.

Delicious every time!""",g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,Simple; but homemade.  Good people watching.  Prices cheap.  I took my family on Spring Break; 2013.

Great people watching.,g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,Must say my favorite hamburger joint! Too bad I have not seen one of these franchises on the East Coast! Very friendly staff! Easy to read menu! Price cannot be beat for the Food I had ordered! I timed that food was delivered exactly in 10 mins,g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,We don't have In-N-Out in Oregon so every time I'm in CA I go. I was thrilled to find they had one near our hotel and would've eaten it for every meal if I could but self-control kicked in. This place was speedy considering the lunch rush; the staff friendly and the food AMAZING! I can't believe how inexpensive it is and appreciate the quality coming out of a fast food joint which I normally avoid. Still drooling thinking of my burger...,g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,Great cheap quality fod. This place gets packed fast!!,g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,Love this location and so close to our house.   Huge dining area and always clean plus the drive thru is quick and efficient.   Come for the burgers which are so inexpensive and you also have to get the fresh cut fries.   The double double burger is huge and throw on some onions and you have one awesome burger.   If you are lucky while in the drive thru you may see them actually cutting the fries.   The service is always top notch and the food comes out quickly.   Got to hand it to them the food is extremely fresh and always tasty and juicy.  I remember when they first opened the drive thru line was about 30-40 minutes long so I dropped my wife at Nordstrom Rack; the kids were small at the time and asleep so I went thru the drive thru in about 45 minutes so my wife got to shop the kids got a good nap and my stomach was happy.,g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,You can't go wrong with a double-double and animal fries.  Good quick tasty burger for a reasonable price.  This specific location was clean; with polite staff and in what seemed to be a relatively central location in Scottsdale.  First class.,g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,What's not to love about a grilled cheese sandwich; animal style? It's like a salad on a bun and costs $1.95.  I'll take two.,g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,I like this place for a cheap meal but the food is always fresh. The burgers are always juicy and fresh but thin. That's okay cause they are so good. The fries are so good and freshly cut.  Service is always fast and friendly. Good burger place that we will always come visit.,g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,This is the Best fast food burger anyWhere to be found; BETTER THAN FIVE GUYS and RAY'S HELL BURGER HANDS DOWN.  IT IS FLAVORFUL AND DELICIOUS; NOT GREASY AND NOT OVERPRICED!  THE BUN IS GOOD AND THE CONDIMENTS ARE GREAT TOO!  The other thing is the polite and courteous staff; the place is immaculate too!  I wish they'd coem out East!,g9jX2oXQr8zrOQgynYnYjQ,In-N-Out is predictable. If that is the only thing a chain would be graded on then every location I have been to would be a 5. Every food item is always fresh but I think a bit short on flavor. The portions are not over kill nor is the price. It will always take longer than average for a burger place to get your order. My visit here was based on predictable being what I was in the mood for that day.,ykKSshfa9ANCZCuvM2LaWg,The pot roast sandwich is always a winner.  I happen to enjoy their chocolate malted milkshakes  Culvers is fast food for adults - great flavor; excellent quality and modest prices.   We have become fans - when we need a quick lunch or a bit of dinner; Culver's is our #1 go-to spot - followed closely by Pei Wei.,ykKSshfa9ANCZCuvM2LaWg,If it is a quick burger you are looking for go to Culver's. Plain and simple. Have you ever noticed that very few burger joints have meat that actually taste's like anything anymore? That is because many places now use pre-cooked patties that just get warmed up and slapped on the bun. Sure; not much chance for sickness due to under-cooking but at what cost? Culver's meat patties are very thin and very flavorful. Very similar to a Zip's burger if you have ever had one of those :)  DELISH!,ykKSshfa9ANCZCuvM2LaWg,Horrible service. Amateur management. Mediocre; overpriced food... I'll never go back again.,ykKSshfa9ANCZCuvM2LaWg,"After my trip here last week was thwarted by lunch crowds and no available parking; I returned today; mid-afternoon; and breezed right in. I really like; and have been patronizing; In-N-Out for my beef and cheese fix due to their proximity to home. However; since Culver's not only offers clearly better burgers at a nearly identical price point (yes; you had me at \butter\""); but also the many delights and myriad dairy based dessert wonders that evolve from frozen custard; my heart's preference just has to be Culvers.  For those of you who have been disappointed with their dinner \""sides\"" such as green beans and mashed potatoes; I'm not too surprised since that isn't what these places are really about at all.  Culvers is; in truth; a bloated reincarnation of classic Midwest \""Frozen Custard \"" stands of the 1940's and 50's where the focus was Burgers; Fries; Malts; (and /or Shakes; if you want; or need to; date the poorer cousin.) When in doubt; and if your sweet meter allows; always order the \""malt\"" over the \""shake\"" for a one of a kind flavor upgrade.  The changing economies and demographics of the '60's and beyond forced the quaint; focused places to add all the oddities and dinner stuff you find today in order to exist. Stick with the basics and you should be happy here. And speaking of basics; I'm reading that a number of you aren't happy with the cheese curds. That prep is as simple as bread and butter; so if Culvers is screwing that up; shame on them.  Anyway; the service here on a Monday afternoon was great. Three cooks through the window were jabbering like monkeys that hadn't come down from the lunch rush yet; (or?) but the woman that took my order was composed and friendly. Ditto the girl who handed me the \""to go\"" bag.  Also; since I'm a single diner preferring to dine out in-home; I've developed a reliable weight-to value indicator in my left hand. (the  one carrying the sack) After taste and satisfaction are factored; Culvers was the hands down winner over 7 previous contenders. 2 bacon double cheese deluxe; Score!  With Culvers website showing a soon to open location at 4506 E. Cactus; (within spitting distance of In-N-Out's Tatum and Cactus store) I have serious concerns over the future for In-N Out's employees at that location. Polish your resumes; kids.""",ykKSshfa9ANCZCuvM2LaWg,Excellent all the way around! Very clean; great menu; great frozen custard; friendly service; reasonable prices....I'll never go to Micky D's again.,ykKSshfa9ANCZCuvM2LaWg,I'm from Wisconsin so Culver's is a little piece of home to me.  Midwest meats make the patties for the delicious butter burgers... yes; butter makes those burgers SOOO delicious. The dairy to make the custard is from wisconsin; the cheese curds to make the fried cheese curds are from wisconsin... it's too good!  There's always vanilla custard; chocolate custard and flavor of the day.  And when I say custard I don't mean ice cream or anything like it... it's FAR better; creamier and more flavorful!  Check their website or drive by to see what the flavor of the day is.  Also; join their email list and get amazing coupons!!  LOVE the food. The service is great. The prices are amazing.  AND ITS ALL FROM WISCONSIN!!,ykKSshfa9ANCZCuvM2LaWg,This was my first time at Culver's.  I had a butter burger with cheese.  It was very good; I thought similar in taste and quality to In and Out. The cheese curds were fantastic; I highly recommend them.  They taste basically like a good mozzarella stick appetiser at other restaurants. Also had a cookie dough concrete mixer.  It was as good as advertised.  Thick and tasty. Only detractors to coming here-cost and high fat/high calorie.  High fat/high calorie goes with any fast food though.  The cost however is much more than a typical fast food place.  $24-26 for two of us getting food basket combo and two med concrete mixers.  So not extremely costly; but more than typical fast food.,ykKSshfa9ANCZCuvM2LaWg,I have family members who love this place!  We met up today and I can see why.  I don't eat fast food as a rule but ended up having a grilled cheese; side salad; and strawberry shake. My family had fried chicken and burgers; along with frozen custatds.  This place is definitely a few steps above Mickey D's; etc.  The service is good; as are the prices.  I do appreciate the pricing and opportunity to order a children's meal.  For my fast-food loving friends; it's a thumbs up.,ykKSshfa9ANCZCuvM2LaWg,4 Stars for the food and the company caring about quality more than other places.  -1 Star for them allowing a homeless guy to pester me and most likely others at a place where I am forced to park and wait for my food and I can't leave if I want my money's worth. They are also lucky I don't -1 more Star for the girl working there at the moment I am writing this review. She was very short and rude and annoying. She was literally mad at me from the minute I drove up to the speaker because I wanted to take a moment to look at the menu which I am still not familiar with (and ask my wife on the phone what we should get). Then she was even more mad at me for asking for honey mustard at the window. I felt very happy to hand over $20 (which I never spend on restaurants anywhere) to receive this treatment from a place that is trying to be more dignified fast food. I expect this treatment at a lame joint; but this is supposed to be Culver's.  Also; I don't care for the chocolate custard/ice cream whatever they call it. It tastes like Wendy's frosty. That's lame.  Other than that it is a place with decent burgers and the toppings/mix-ins cover up the cheap ice cream well enough to get it more than once.  ***UPDATE***  -3 Stars for food poisoning to top off the experience. I regret going; and wish I had ordered pizza (which is saying something).,ykKSshfa9ANCZCuvM2LaWg,Sara B. wrote exactly what I was thinking.  I'm a big fan of Culvers.  This place puts every day fast food to shame.  Their food isn't sitting there waiting for someone to order it.  It's fresh and made to order.  They have a huge menu of options at good prices and you get quality service with a smile.,ykKSshfa9ANCZCuvM2LaWg,I LOVE CULVER'S!!!!  It's from the midwest.  I had not tried Culver's until I met my now husband(he's from Illinois); who introduced me to this awesome place.  Since that first meeting; I was hooked.  Now locations are popping up everywhere.  I love it.    They are best known for their Butter Burgers and their Custard.  Me; personally; I will go there just for the custard.  I recommend a small or medium chocolate custard concrete mixer with brownie pieces.  Yummy!!!  Don't get a large; because that is way too much; you'll get a tummy ache.  If ever I'm feeling down; I will always turn to Culver's.  Their butter burgers are good as well.  Low fat and low in calories....Yeah right.  But they sure are tasty.    My friend is from Wisconsin and will go here just for the cheese curds.    Culver's is a place to go once in awhile as a treat to yourself; because the prices are little on the high side.  Besides you don't want to spoil yourself too much; otherwise you might lose appreciation for it.  Definitely go here.,ykKSshfa9ANCZCuvM2LaWg,If they had a Culver's on every street corner; the cardiologists would all have twice as much money. I went there for my first time today for lunch; and I was hoping for a good; non-processed burger. I got my wish; a soft bun; red onions; lettuce; fresh tomatoes... all the fixings were great. The cheese was very good; and the beef patties were also good. (I got the deluxe). Since I never had fried cheese curds; I got those as my side item.  It was very reasonably priced; $8 or so for the combo with a root beer. Service was fast; food was fresh and hot. But here's the kicker.... I looked up the nutrional information after lunch; when I felt like I couldn't get out of my office chair. This combo had 84g of fat and 3000mg of sodium.  Even if you don't watch what you eat; these numbers should scare the hell out of you. To put it into perspective; my diet calls for 1500mg sodium DAILY.  I could've gone to In-N-Out; gotten an animal style double-double with fries and saved 15 grams of fat and saved 1300mg sodium. I could've ordered 2 quarter pounders with cheese and 2 large fries and still eaten fewer grams of fat and sodium. Now do you see exactly how bad these burgers are for you?!? Imagine if I had gotten the bacon cheeseburger with a custard for dessert. That'd be another 30 grams of fat. We're talking triple digits here. Scary stuff. Now; I like to splurge on occasion for great food. Unfortunately; for that caloric catastrophe; it simply wasn't worth it. It's a good burger; definitely better than the typical fast food; but come on. These numbers are beyond reasonable.  To be fair; the fried cheese curds constituted 38g of fat alone. Now that I've had them for the first time in my life; I'll say I enjoyed them. They're almost as good as fried mozzarella; but I still prefer the Italian version over the Wisconsin one. So if you want to splurge; enjoy the custard. I've had it once before here; and it's excellent; especially the vanilla. But if you want to blow your diet; even though the food is decent here; do it somewhere else.,fJ5raoVcN-nD8vFswMFXzQ,When I am at home living the high life in Queen Creek; this is my closest Chipotle. I do tend to prefer it to the Costa Vida across the street; although some times the lines can be long. A big ole' burrito is always good; but typically I go with the chicken bowl. Two chicken bowls and a side of chips & quac will run about $16; but it is good for what is somewhat fast  food.   This location always has good service. I visited last night and asked the guy for some of the fajita vegetables - no problem. I ordered the chicken bowl and he said they barely had enough for one serving; so if I wanted he would give me half chicken and have steak.  Which leads to why this is 4 stars and not 5 - apparently chicken is the big seller; so why would you run out? I have to admit since I received the last of the chicken I wasn't really as concerned as the lady behind me who was told it would be a six and a half minute wait while the guy finished grilling the chicken. Maybe its just me; but if you know folks like to eat chicken; is it that difficult to look in the bucket; see it getting low and think maybe you need to throw some yard birds on the fire?   Maybe a little operations management/inventory control is needed - but the food and service receives high marks!,fJ5raoVcN-nD8vFswMFXzQ,"Finally; the infamous Chipotle.  No matter what food destiny could await me; my mind will forever be \stained\"" with the memory of the hilarious South Park \""Chipotle-Away\"" infomercial; with Billy Mays hawking a laundry spray to take away Chipotle-related skidmarks...  For those wondering why I would still try it: I actually heard numerous raves from a buddy who used to eat at one in Colorado Springs.  He still insists on pronouncing it \""Chi-Pole-Tay.\""  I told him that it's the same as a chipotle pepper--he comes back saying the pepper is \""Chi-Pote-Lay\"" but the resto says it \""Chi-Pole-Tay.\""  Sorry; but South Park says otherwise.  Anyway; the Chipotle chain seems to be thriving; converting a lot of people.  I wonder if those people ever eat at real Mexican places.  If you don't have real Mexican food available; you might be impressed on what Chipotle offers.  I'd give this location 2 1/2 stars.  The menu is pretty limited: soft or crispy tacos; burritos/fajita burritos; \""burrito bowls;\"" salads; and chips w/guac.  You can choose from about 6-7 kinds of meat (or veg options) depending on what you order.  I didn't want fajitas or just veg.; so I had to decide between grilled carne asada; grilled chicken; barbacoa (shredded beef); or carnitas (shredded pork).    When we first walked in; we were told there was no rice ready; and there would be about 1/2 hr. wait if we wanted rice.  A girl ahead of us in line walked out.  Not being from the area; we didn't want to go back into the heat and drive; so we decided to kick it.  Fortunately for us (sorry rice girl!) we were then told that it would only be a couple of minutes; and to go ahead and order.  I checked out the meats in the metal serving bins; they looked like they had been sitting for about an hour...shredded meat looked totally dried out --I opted for the grilled beef which didn't look as bad.  What looked really good was the guacamole--freshly pounded and still chunky with avocado.  The guac was $1.40 extra; but it looked good enough to be worth it; and what better way to moisten a potentially dry burrito.  I'm leery of any sour cream that sits out; so I opted for cheese instead; rice; lettuce; hot sauce; and black beans (pinto being the other option).  The rice is a white cilantro-lime rice.  You can also get corn; which I'm about as likely to add to a burrito as an Oldsmobile.  Luckily for me; the kid @ the register didn't charge me for the guacamole addition (he saw me flinch a little when told about the extra charge); so I got the deal.  That move earned your business an extra 1/2 star kid; pushing this review into the 3-star (therefore acceptable) zone.  Way to go!  Since the company might not appreciate your giving that stuff away for free; I'll neglect to thank you by name; so you can keep your job n' all.  Also; Coke Zero was available as a fountain drink; which was a happy surprise to me.  The burrito was pretty average in both size and quality.  The guacamole was really tasty; but none of the other ingredients; including the meat or salsa; stood out flavor wise.  The gringo-fied rice and relative blandness of it gave it more of a \""wrap\"" taste than the more authentic burritos I'm used to.  Not bad; just kind of blah.  A decent; inoffensive meal; no more; no less.  I've had worse.       I accept the concept of Americanized; or; as Chipotle calls it; \""gourmet\"" Mexican food.  In the Santa Barbara area; despite having a few authentic places; 15-20 years ago (when I lived there) one of my favorite Mexican places was very \""California healthy Mex;\"" i.e.; quite inauthentic.  If the quality and value is there; why not.  But I wouldn't say the quality of Chipotle is anything approaching \""gourmet.\""  Plus the price--if the kid had charged me for the guacamole; that would have been an $8 burrito.  If you're gonna charge that much; kick up the portion size.  I've paid $4.50-$6.50 for HUGE burritos many times; what I like to call \""bricks o' food\"" that could easily provide two meals.  That's including avocado or guacamole.  I don't mind paying a little more; but at least make it worth my while..  The guacamole stood out; other than that; meh!!  For what it's worth; Chipotle does seem to have a commitment to organic and healthy ingredients.  And; I'm happy to say; I did avoid the fate that South Park was warning me about.  I guess with that; the convenience; and the generosity of the worker; this \""Chi-Pole-Tay\"" gets a passing grade...but not much else.""",fJ5raoVcN-nD8vFswMFXzQ,Not much needs to be said about Chipotle's food in general... if you've never been to one; I suggest going immediately; like; right now; or you might as well jump off a cliff because life is just not worth living (jk; don't really do that).  Chipotle's food is delish; consistent; healthy; fast; fresh; environmentally conscious; and well priced.  What more can you ask for?  If this will be your first Chipotle experience; get a chicken burrito (currently $6.25); with a side of chips and guac ($2.95)... you can't go wrong!  Regarding this specific Queen Creek location; I am a frequent.  95% of the time; I submit my order via the Chipotle app in the Apple Appstore.  Very easy and fun to order this way.  I almost always get the chicken (occasionally the carnitas); because I've found that the other meats (steak; shredded beef) are just not that great... the steak is a bit chewy for my taste.  Anyway; the orders are usually complete within 5 minutes of the pickup time confirmation; but it is not unusual for me to show up a few minutes after the pickup time and they haven't even started it yet.  They are usually very kind and accommodating about it; and may even offer free drinks or chips for the inconvenience... and once; they even paid for the meal followed up by one of the employees calling my phone to apologize and ask about the problem.  They do seem to have a pretty decently high turnover of the staff.  Not sure what to make of that; but it does cause some hiccups in the service (including running out of guacamole once; which was very depressing... because it's sooo good; and I can barely live without it) as they are training the new employees.  But in all the turnover; I have only come in contact with one employee who should not have been working there; and he doesn't anymore; thankfully.  All in all; even though this is not the best Chipotle location; it has top quality Chipotle food; friendly employees; and a pleasant atmosphere.,fJ5raoVcN-nD8vFswMFXzQ,"Having been an employee of Chipotle you would expect horror stories from me I am sure but that is not the case.  In the year I worked there I never once witnessed anything that would make me not want to eat there again; I have eaten there several dozens of times since I left my job and when I was pregnant it was my craving for guacamole that kept me going! It is clean; fast and delicious!   My only complaint would be the pricing; for two people it would be about $20-$25 with drinks which is pricey for a \faster food\"" type setting but it is delicious and large portions so it balances itself out for the most part.""",fJ5raoVcN-nD8vFswMFXzQ,Always love coming to here ; great food low prices ; workers are really friendly ; but today was really loud workers screaming for Morgan ; workers laughing so loud from the back heard them all the way out front ;  people eating actually looking all around to see who was screaming; then one workers yelled to the others to shut up ;if you can put up with that then go.

Late night drunken carne asada fries? Check!  Tasty adobada burrito? Check!   Rolled tacos smothered in guac and cheese? You know it!  Prices are reasonable; quality is consistent and good; and flavor is never lacking""",rB1CNenQbYtQ0D6sqoJe3A,Not impressed; and it does not take alot to make me twinkle. The burritos are half the size and twice the price.oh and if you complain ; they act like Apple. Love it or leave; whats the alternative?..Taco Bell?..  I'll stay away for now; as always keep shopping around and don't settle for less. Vote with your dollar!!,cWBqZThx4RWNzPJbJ_oXOg,I do like their food. I like how the kid meals come with something educational instead of some piece of plastic junk. The only thing I would say is for the price; I think their portions could be a little bigger. I am always wanting just a couple more waffle fries.,cWBqZThx4RWNzPJbJ_oXOg,I have been going to Chick-fil-A's all across the country and I absolutely love it!  All of the staff is the highest quality out of any place I've ever been! The food is great; and is pretty well-priced. The prices have gone up over the years; but not enough to truly deter people; I don't believe. The kid area was fun for me years ago; and I know it still holds the same value today. They easily have the best sweet tea out of any place I have ever been to; and am proud to say that I will never stop going to Chick-fil-A!,cWBqZThx4RWNzPJbJ_oXOg,"I like Chick-Fil-A. They deserve props for inventing the chicken sandwich; for the cute cow commercials and for maintaining their religious principles. That said; I don't really care for this location. It's cramped; with a lot of tables and a children's play area crammed into a very small space. Also; no way to refill your soda on your own. Chick-Fil-A overall is a bit expensive for what it is; perhaps in part a consequence of its closed on Sunday policy.  I tried their grilled chicken nuggets a la carte on my recent visit. How disappointing. They came out soggy; sealed in a plastic container; where they had apparently been for quite some time. Gross! Gross! Gross! Definitely no resemblance to the promotional photographs! When I mentioned how disgusting they were to another family member; they immediately asked; \Did you go at lunchtime?\"" \""They make bigger quantities in advance at lunchtime and the food then is never as good.\"" Hmm. Makes some sense; I guess. Still; over five bucks for six tiny slime covered grilled nuggets and the smallest small sized soft drink I've seen in years; leaves me less than enthusiastic in any case. Plus; call me silly; but I like to eat lunch at lunchtime.""",cWBqZThx4RWNzPJbJ_oXOg,Fast food can be delicious; at least at Chik-Fil-A!  I met some moms here for a little play date and lunch; I hate McD's and this is another option - a better; cleaner; more nutritious and delicious option.  UPS: My daughter hates nuggets; any nuggets; anywhere.  She LOVED these nuggets and the fruit cup; she finished it all!    The play area is smaller but it's nicer and cleaner and has less kids running around (at least on this afternoon).  They have delicious and fresh salad options which also come with their scrumptious chicken (you can get grilled too).  Love the dressings!  Friendly and helpful staff.  DOWNS: A little pricey for those fresh salad options (almost $8)  Sucky kids toys (comic book?),D0tHnskAgaRjCBdoXVev_g,"As far as fast food places go; Popeyes is bomb-diggity.  I love; love; love the fact that they feature a Cajun theme to their food.  I love their Cajun season salt that you can add to everything.  Their \Cajun Sparkle\"" may be a more generic version of Tony Chachere's Cajun Seasoning; but once you've gotten hooked on this condiment (which is ubiquitous in Louisiana); it is heartening to find it available.  My favorite thing about Popeye's is the spicy chicken.  It usually is more flavorful and juicier than the Colonel's anyways (Oh... how the mighty have fallen!).  I also like that they offer crawfish dishes seasonally; yet I somehow always seem to time it wrong and not make it in during that window.  My current understanding is that they offer these goodies in November; including crawfish po'boys and crawfish etouffee! I must be more vigilant so that I can scrabble them mudbugs up in my chops!  Just try to find another fast food place that dares to put \""etouffee\"" on their menu... I dare you; dammit!  Anyhow... little known fact for all you Cajun food fans out there.  You can buy Cajun-seasoned deep-fried turkeys at Popeyes during the holidays.  We picked up out Thanksgiving turkey at this store and were thrilled to death with it.  It is fully cooked and frozen when you get it.  And it's not terribly cheap... $50 for a 12-lb bird (or so).  But it is delicious! Still requires about two hours of cooking time... all the instructions are included.  Be aware these sell out fast. Having nearly missed the boat (last Thxgiving; I got the last bird at this store); I would look no later than two weeks before Thanksgiving to get your turkey.  And call them beforehand to be sure. Not every store carries holiday Turkeys.  I can't tell you if they offer these for Christmastime; neither.  So be forewarned; Pilgrim!""",D0tHnskAgaRjCBdoXVev_g,This is one of the better Popeyes restaurants in this part of town. It is a full service location and not part of a stinky gas station or quickie store. The inside is decorated with jars of chili peppers and other fun ingredients and there is a bigger seating area than some of the others stores.   Usually stop in here when I'm in the area picking up some industrial parts for the shop. It is close to several vendors and a quick and easy meal when my stomach is growling for some Cajun yummies.  Normally order something off the Spicy side of the menu and get several Jalapenos to wash things down. The dark meat is a treat and I like to get a bunch of thighs and avoid the less juicy white meat. Must say that the Red Beans and Rice are also a favorite and like to save them for dessert.  Service is always super friendly and you will see some of the same people working here over the years. The orders come out pretty quick and the food is consistently very tasty.  Watch out for the bus load of school kids that walk over during their lunch break. The place can get really busy and the wait times can take longer than usual. Whatever happened to the lame brown bag lunches that we were forced to eat back in the days?   See ya there next time and remember Tuesday they have their 2pc chicken special for super cheap. AYEE!  3.75 STARS,D0tHnskAgaRjCBdoXVev_g,"Allow me to preface by saying that I'm rating this as a fast-food chicken joint.  Comparables are places like KFC and Louisiana Fried Chicken and Churches (etc).  I'm not comparing to Pappadeaux's or anyplace like that.  We were coming from a work out.  Didn't eat much before (hard to work out on a full stomach...sometimes get to feeling really sick when we do that).  So we were HUNGRY!  A craving for chicken was in the air; and especially Louisiana Fried Chicken.  But there was a notice on their door that the landlord had locked them out.  Consulting YELP we spotted \Popeye's\"".  So off we go!  The place didn't look special at all.  Routine fast-food look with a drive-thru.  Menu was similar to other fast food chicken places; except the \""Cajun rice\""; \""Cajun fries\""; \""red beans and rice\""; and \""Jambalaya\"".  You can get the chicken \""regular\"" or \""Cajun\"".  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  I went with a deal they had painted on their window; and then ordered some extras (Jambalaya and two sides).  Then realized maybe there was a deal that would include that and cost less.  The guy looked at the total; checked his board quickly; and said that was the best way to get what I wanted.  The food took about as long as expected for a fast food chicken joint.  The fries were like most seasoned fries I've had.  Maybe a little more kick; but not much more.  They were very good; but didn't jump up and say \""Cajun\"" to me.  The Cajun rice was similar to a dirty rice (Cajun); and was good.  Not spicy (hot); but very tasty.  The Jambalaya was also good.  Again; not spicy.  Not comparable to Pappadeaux's.  But good.  We ordered half/half for the chicken so we could try the regular and the spicy.  The regular was like KFC used to be long ago (when KFC was \""Kentucky Fried Chicken\""; and was good).  It was your basic good fried chicken.  The spicy was a bit inconsistent.  Some pieces were \""I feel the burn\"" while others were more mild.  I preferred the spicy anyway.  Good fried chicken with a bit more flavor.  Frankly; I prefer the food at Louisiana Fried Chicken; but that doesn't do much good since they are evidently out of business (unless they can pay-off the landlord and get un-locked-out).  Popeye's was very good for what it is.  I foresee Popeye's being our new Cajun chicken joint for now.  If LFC comes back I may have to re-evaluate.  But we were very happy with the food we got here.  In fact; we even had the leftovers for lunch today!  :-)""",M_GnuvRXvWBl3YNxH-GYFg,Awesome Friendly Staff  Fast; Reliable Service  Reasonably Priced Healthy Options  The only downfall I have is the stinginess in the portion sizes of the chicken and steak; so make sure you clarify that you are getting the right amount of meat.  Aside from this one drawback this place is great.,M_GnuvRXvWBl3YNxH-GYFg,I think most people in the valley are familiar with burritos so this is more of a thumbs up for this location. The main reason I come here is for the vegetarian pinto beans ( the other burrito place adds delicious pork ).  The veggie burritos are good and they aren't cheap with the guacamole.  The service lately is kind of hit or miss and they are always low on stuff.  THey are always really friendly; but they need to puck up the food prep planning a bit.,M_GnuvRXvWBl3YNxH-GYFg,"If I could rate this place as a zero; I definitely would. My husband and I decided to try Qdoba; as we had never been there before. Stopped in for a quick bite of lunch; I ordered a shredded beef burrito; my husband; a veggie burrito. The girl behind the counter looked confused when I told her I wanted shredded beef on my burrito and that it wasn't a veggie burrito. After understanding that I actually wanted beef; she put three whole pieces of meat. I seemed to have inconvenienced her in asking to put more meat on my burrito. My husband then had to remind her that he'd ordered a veggie burrito; and actually wanted veggies on it. Once we finally made it down the line; we went to pay for the food. The girl rambled what the price was and before we knew it; we had paid almost $23 for two burritos; chips and a small drink. Something definitely did not add up correctly. We looked at the prices we were charged on the receipt and compared to what they had on the menu boards; and realized we were charged significantly more than what the menu stated. My husband went to ask the girl behind the counter what was going on and she said they had changed the prices. She then called the manager over; who again; reiterated that the menu prices had changed; they just hadn't received the updated price signage. There was nothing anywhere in the store stating that any of their prices were changed; we had to hear about it after we were already over charged for our items. At this point in time; the \manager;\"" interrogated us and asked; \""didn't you look at the price on the pos system before you paid??\"" The pos system didn't display what we had ordered nor did it display the price. My husband demanded to be refunded back the difference; and the manager said they were not allowed to give refunds; and they would need to call corporate in order to get one. We were interrogated again and asked if we had already started eating the food; which was said in a very sarcastic way by the manager. She then spent a decent amount of time on the phone with \""corporate\"" asking if she could give a refund; to which \""corporate\"" offered to give us food vouchers for another visit. As we don't live in the area; there was no way we were going to accept that and wanted a refund of the difference. The manager said she didn't know how to use the computer or issue a refund for what we were asking; and ended up refunding the entire meal. She then acted as if she was doing us a favor by allowing us to keep our food items. We probably would have been better off not even touching the food; and going somewhere else. The four pieces of meat that were in my burrito were not very tasty; and overall the food quality was very poor. To top off the experience; the cashier mishandled the customers food behind us. Initially refused to offer her food at the menu price; and treated them worse than she treated us. The best part of this experience was walking out the door; and vowing to never come back.""",nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,I've been meaning to check this place out for a long time. I was in the area and decided to stop in. The serving size is great for the price. The veggies were fresh and I liked the dressing as well. If I'm in the area around lunch time I will def be back.,nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,I remember when they first opened and I tried their Cobb Salad...I was not impressed for some reason. I'm not sure why... maybe because they just opened and it wasn't good before? A Couple months later;  I started to give this place another try and then another and then another....Then I found myself going here like every week! I tried most of their salads on their menu and I tried their kale/banana & strawberry/kale drink which was surprisingly really good. I must say that I am a big fan of this place now and on days where I don't want to cook but I want something healthy; this is the go to spot for me. I'm actually glad that this place opened because instead of fast food drive thru's there is now a salad on the go!  I'm a little bummed that they don't have their special anymore though...it was the butternut squash salad. That was my all time favorite but their special right now which is the kale caesar is also very tasty!  Their salads are fresh and for the price they give you a lot! Go check it out!,nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,"Do I eat enough vegies?  No way.  I have to get all psyched up to eat a bowl of greens.  Rabbit food.  This place opened up just there on the corner from where I live and I thought; well... good for them!  Healthy food.  Boy; that's great... I hope they make it.  It took the persuading of a friend to get me to go there with him.  And I'll tell you...  If you walk up or drive up.. just go and give this place some business because it's just the best!   Check out the kids menu.  Amazing.  I mean just think if kids ate this delicious and nutritious food instead of the fast food we all grew up with.    The selection and creativity of salads is A1.  And the portion is large enough to feed 2 or 3 people as a side salad.  Price is right on.  I had the cob salad with feta cucumber dressing and I just woofed it down.  My body's like; hey! Live enzymes and their yummy!  I can feel my brain cells regenerating as I type.  Just think folks.  What if we give this place so much business that they open another one and another one and  pretty soon there's more \fast food\"" salad restaurants than McDonald's!  Hey; I can dream; can't I?  One complaint I have is the Asian salad dressing is too SPICY.""",nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,"Great concept for the \on the go; no time to cook\""; person like me.I have always liked the convenience of fast food and now there is a healthy; delicious option with Salad and Go. I live in Central Phoenix and make it a point that anytime I'm in the Gilbert/Chandler area to stop by and grab lunch; or a salad to save for dinner. My three favorites: Spinach and Smoked Bacon; The Santa Fe; and The Asian. The portions are great for the price; huge bowls of mixed greens; tossed in handcrafted dressings; with fresh; delicious proteins available; my favorite salad topper- the grilled flank steak; Yum! Although the drive thru line is long; give it a shot; its worth it. And if you don't want to wait in the drive thru than park; and walk up to the window. Be patient; this food isn't sitting premade and ready to go; it's fresh and made to order. Good things come to those who wait; I can't wait for the restaurant to expand. Kudos to you guys at Salad and Go; for giving us a healthy option to the run of the mill; greasy burger joints that we are all guilty of stopping by for a quick bite.""",nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,So happy this place is finally here. Me and my family have visited quite a few times and it has been wonderful each time. The wait can be a little long but it's not like there is employees sitting around playing on their phones; twiddling thumbs. I have seen them through the window-HUSTLING trying to be the quickest they can be and i appreciate you guys. EXCEPTIONAL customer service. I think it's silly how people are complaining about the sizes and prices. These are very generous sizes in my opinion. I usually can only eat half at a time and to say they are overpriced?? Did you know they use organic and local ingredients? I saw that is an AMAZING price for what you get. My favorite is the Greek salad super yummy. Me and my husband will continue to send people your way and congrats on doing so well! #supportlocalbusinesses,nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,I'm kind of obsessed with this place. Not because it has the greatest salads on earth; but because it has a drive through and walk up window. Having never seen a fast food salad place before this is quite a novelty. Plus it is really cheap and pretty good quality. I always get the Cobb with steak.,nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,This place is fabulous!  Finally; a healthy alternative to fast food.  For near the same price you have a salad instead of driving through one of the other fast food joints that just going to make you feel crappy later.  This place makes doing healthy during a crazy hectic week with the kids a doable concept....  I hope they stay around forever!  My faves so far Santa Fe and BBQ Ranch.. The Santa Fe really doesn't even need any added protein and the BBQ ranch has avocados!  loaded with healthy stuff! :),nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,I was excited to give this place a try after reading a lot about it.  I had been craving the Caprese with Steak salad.  Get there to order at 4:30 pm on a Friday; and they tell me they are all out of steak. OK; so I settled for the chicken and ordered two other salads to take home for the wife and daughter that they had picked out on the web.  For a salad place; it took a long time to get the food.  Get home and one of the salads is wrong. Not even close to what I orderded and talk about stingy with dressing.  For the cost; it would be much cheaper to make my own salad at home not to mention quicker and I would know it was the salad I wanted.  I doubt that I will eat there again. There is no compelling reason to do so.,nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,I was excited to give this place a try after reading a lot about it.  I had been craving the Caprese with Steak salad.

It's a very convenient drive through with outdoor seating.  It's clean and the owners care about us.  The manager was patient with me when I asked about organics. They serve large filling salads for an inexpensive price.  As a single person who has fresh food spoil in the refrigerator; I would like to divert my whole grocery budget to them.,nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,I love Salad and Go.

Healthy; reasonably priced salad drive thru. Oh and not to be forgotten; AMAZING breakfast.   My obsession with Salad and Go started in a cool morning with a warm berry quinoa bowl. So feeling good! It'll make you forget you ever had any desire for oatmeal in your past life.   Then I tried a caprese salad and the obsession grew. It's a HUGE salad (seriously three meals worth for me) bursting with pesto and balsamic. And for a little over $5?? Sold.   Then; addiction set in with a breakfast bowl. Anytime someone wants to give me red potatoes; pico de gallo and avocado for breakfast; I am totally in...at first I thought it was odd that's it's really more of a salad breakfast bowl (ie: the tons of fresh spinach leaves they serve up for you for breakfast) but holy breakfast...mix that in with some egg whites and I am SOLD for life on this.   Oh...and the iced coffee? Yum. I am such a coffee snob and I love theirs.   Everyone is super friendly and they even have organic dog bones for the furry kids if you bring them along for the ride.   Grab a salad and go at your next available opportunity; you will thank me (and them).,nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,This place is AWESOME! Just happy that there is finally a healthy place for fast food.  I had the caprese salad and it was great!  Overall this is a place to try- easy; healthy; tastes good; and affordable prices!,nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,My only complaint is there aren't more of these. I was so impressed with the concept; I actually went to their website to inquire about a franchise... (which I can't afford; but still...)   Huge portion sizes; super quick service; reasonable prices.   Gourmet custom salads on the go... they definitely have a niche vs. taking forever to go to paradise bakery.,nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,Love it! We live about 9 miles from here but still make the drive. The salads are very fresh and high quality. It may seem a little high in price after adding protein (chicken; steak; prawns etc) but it really isn't; you could make two meals out of if you wanted to. Just have them do the dressing on the side (with an extra) rather then toss it in and it will keep long enough to have the next day. My wife and I wish they would open one south of the San Tan 202 to save a 30 min round trip drive.,nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,Quick; yummy and inexpensive! Location is great too.,nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,This place is AWESOME! They use local ingredients; very reasonable prices; and the portions are huge. Fast and friendly. While in the drive-thru you can peek in and they are always using gloves; washing their hands; etc. A few more salad choices would be nice but it's such a  novel idea so I can't complain! Lunch time is super busy; faster to go to stand in window. Their organic sodas are also very yummy!,nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,I have been excited to try Salad and Go for a few weeks now. I went late on a Saturday morning and there was absolutely no one there. I was greeted quickly and reviewed the menu. I knew I wanted a salad but couldn't decide which one. They all sounded so good! I decided on the Asian salad. I was pleasantly surprised when they asked if I wanted the dressing tossed or on the side. I opted for tossed. The salad was just ok for me. The ingredients were all fresh and nicely proportioned however the dressing was bland. I could have used more dressing and some more flavor. The chicken was nice and didn't taste like that fake chicken you sometimes get on fast food salads. I am still giving this place 4 starts because I love the concept; prices are reasonable and the ingredients were so fresh. I will be going back and trying a different kind of salad. Maybe next time I will ask for extra dressing.,nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,Good variety of salads; excellent dressings and excellent price for what you get!!  Also VERY nice it gives you the caloric value of every salad WITH dressing.  Heck they even give you the caloric value of the dressings they list!!!  Its a great way to stay on track if you are watching the waistline.  I have tried this place twice and they have not disappointed.  Don't expect fancy dining here people....There is a small patio with a mister and a drive through.  Heck; I don't care if they served these from a cart!  I should have had lunch from here today....For those parents out there; a $3.99 kids meal that is ACTUALLY healthy - options are a salad or a PB & J!!!  Good value and good for your family too!,nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,Had the Cobb Salad in a wrap. It was huge and the price was right. This place is good and I love local and original restaurants. It is primarily a takeout place; but there is an outdoor seating area that is well shaded and has a mist system. Food was good; service was quick; and all in all I am sure to be back.,nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,Salads are ok. first time here for the price it's better then getting a salad at a fast food place. Everything is fresh but just didn't love it if you eat there it smells a bit weird outside. Not sure what the smell is.,nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,Love this place; wish it wasn't so expensive but what organic healthy food isn't a lot.,nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,Everything is perfect: huge; gourmet salads at a reasonable price in a DRIVE-THRU!!!   These guys have a great concept.,nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,I stumbled across this place as I was going to the bank. It's a small little place where you go up to the window and order. You can't go inside to sit and they have 3 small little tables outside. I got  their BBQ ranch salad. The salad was ok and reasonably priced.,nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,Excellent salads! You can't beat this level of quality; and service for these prices and convenience. They were even nice to our dog that they saw in the car. They are restaurant quality.,nUUYvBafHYH-O4Pht6lgsw,Really loved it! Went there today for my first time! Had always wanted to try it! i go there and i ordered; everything was perfect when i got home! Huge portion for the price! love everything and will be back very soon! I Also took my dog and the lady at the window gave her a biscuit :) A+ in my book!,2xczXFsc4GeilxL8B8R3Vg,I have always seen these on my trips to AZ but I have never been.  Stopped by tonight after the Diamondbacks/Cardinals game.  Went through the drive through (Open 24 hours) and ordered a double Whataburger and a medium vanilla shake.  I added cheese to my burger.....kind of lame here is that they charge you 50 cents per slice....so since I got a double burger; it was 50 cents per patty= $1.00 for cheese.  Oh well.........  My total was just under $9.00.  Here is how the burger and shake were.............  Double Whataburger w/cheese-  Damn Gina!  This thing was a hefty ass burger.  You could tell by the bag the dude handed me it was large and in charge.  I parked and unwrapped this beast.  The Whataburger comes standard with mustard; lettuce; onion; pickle and tomato.  This thing was damn tasty.  They use 100% all beef fresh meat.  While I was waiting for my food in the drive through; you could hear the sizzle on the flat top grill of freshly made hamburgers.  I was impressed!  Everything worked.  It reminded me of a Wendys type burger but better.  The patties were huge; the cheese melted nice and the mustard gave it a good tang.  I wouldn't hesitate to get another one of these burgers.  I liked it better than the burger I got last night at Lucky Boy.  Vanilla Shake-  This was a tad of a disappointment.  It was kind of icy and not as smooth as I like my shakes.  It is still a shake though and no man in his right mind would ever waste a shake.  I drank that thing till the straw hit the bottom of the cup and nothing else came out.  I don't know if I would get one again from here.  The texture was messing with my enjoyment of it.  Overall I was very impressed with the quality/taste of the burger.  The burger is a mans size burger...no skimpy shit here.  Price was a little high though and the shake was just alright.  3 stars for now.,ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,I have eaten there a few times. And the burgers are pretty good and they give you a crazy amount of fries. My daughter loves the soda machine. But it is over priced so we would eat there more if it was cheaper.,ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,I have eaten there a few times. And the burgers are pretty good and they give you a crazy amount of fries.

But the burgers and fries are delicious. The burgers are made to order just for you! Has a good amount of toppings for your burger. The fries are amazing! They have spicy fries as well! But for the price; enjoy every bite! If anyone has an recommendations for a good burger in the valley...please let me know!!,ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,Stopped here with my wife and daughter after hearing a few friends say it was amazing;.........Very disappointing; I mean the burgers aren't terrible but they are not great either Just kinda there you know what I mean. pretty pricey as well I think 3 burgers and 1 large order of fries and 3 drinks was like $27. In and out is a much tastier and affordable option.,ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,I always have a great experience at this restaurant. The staff is very friendly and attentive. Quality of food is excellent; from juicy burgers to fresh fries. It is a great place to take our little ones because they have a couple of large tables in the back. Added bonus: the music is always amazing. Yes it is pricey for a burger joint; but you get what you pay for.,ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,Alrighty; so I've only been here once; and that was a handful of years ago; so this review is from memory.  So at the time; this place was fairly new and everyone was talking about it; including some friends I've went to school with.  So of course I had to check it out.   My friend and I went with high expectations (before we used review websites) and the place was packed.  Dont remember exactly what we ordered; but we each got a burger; large fries; and a drink... each.  It cost a little over $30 for the whole meal.  That is nuts; it's a freakin fast food restaurant. The whole paper bag was filled with fries; which doesn't bother me; but they weren't very good.  The burger itself was average at best; not worth what we paid for though.    If we feel like spending $30+ dollars on food; I think we can skip out on average fast food.,ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,"Burgers and fries; huh? In the words of the band BNL \its all be done; woo hoo hoo.\"" I found 5 Guys to be sort of lackluster. First of all; it was extremely packed; and not much room between tables. Spills and bumoing into people were inevitable.  The menu was basic; but I guess they are trying to be great at one thing and not suck at everything. While ordering; the gal there ran thru a 20-word-per-millisecond schpeel that I'm sure she gives everyone; which I had to have her repeat. Prices could've been a little lower; and not wanting to bankrupt my paying friend; I opted to go with a water. The burger I ordered wasn't very hot when I got it; but the fries were legit.  I ended up getting sick that evening; and while I won't blatantly say it was the burger; I have my suspicions.  Honestly; I'd have to compare the food to In N Out or Wendys. Still going to Red Robin for good; quick burgers.""",ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,I'm struggling with this review...  Great burger. Perfectly cooked; two beefy patties and you can add lots of toppings at no extra charge (like mushrooms. Yum).  But seriously; $12 for a burger; fries and a large drink is stupidly expensive.  I devoured my burger; and couldn't finish the huge order of fries; but the entire time I was scarfing it down I kept asking myself if it was worth 12 bucks.  Not really.  But damit; it was tasty.,ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,After hearing so much hype about Five Guys Burgers I decided to try it out.  My conclusion?  OK; but nothing to write home about.    It's cool that you don't have to pay extra for toppings like cheese; mushrooms; etc.; but of course all that is built in to the price (around $6-8 per burger).  Personally I prefer grilled burgers over fried; but it's good quality meat compared to the typical fast food joint (which should be expected given the difference in price).   I didn't care for the fries; although they weren't bad.  A bit soggy for my tastes.  Five Guys is obviously proud of the fact that they use peanut oil--there are posters and burlap bags of peanuts in the store alerting you to that.  While peanut oil is an improvement over canola and corn oil based on its lipid profile; lard would be even healthier and probably taste better. (Of course most people buy into the propaganda that ingesting saturated animal fat clogs one's arteries and leads to obesity and heart disease.  Not true.)    What's interesting to me in reading some of the other reviews is that In-N-Out is held by many to be the standard for good burgers.  Personally I can't stand In-N-Out...I think they're about the worst tasting burgers around.  I would rate Whataburger much higher.  Of course taste is highly subjective; and as the adage goes 'To each their own.'  For what it's worth; I consider Five Guys better than In-N-Out; but that's not saying much in my opinion.    To summarize my view of Five Guys: overrated and overpriced; but not extremely so.,ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,Five Guys is a little pricey when it comes to burger joints but waddling out the door in a near food coma makes it worth it. The portions are huge and totally delicious; I can hardly make it through my burger much less the fries. This place is a winner.,ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,I love 5 guys burgers.....or at least i used to. I visited the power rd. location. They have raised their prices to epic heights and i have eaten there for the last time.. 2 cheeseburgers; 2 fries; 2 drinks.... 30.00 insane!! I have even heard national radio shows talk about how nutz their prices are. Sorry guys...the dollars dont make sense anymore and your prices are higher than a sit down restaurant.  We eat at Freddies steakburgers for 14.50..... 1/2 the price!!! Venezias pizza : 13.95 for 4 huge slices/ toppings and 2 endless drinks. WHERE's the value in 5 guys with their fresh only ingredients; simple store and peanuts??  I see nothing but record profits!,ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,Holy overpriced!  With everyone all abuzz about this place opening up in AZ; I figured we would have to give it a try sometime.  Well; we were out and about in the EV this weekend and figured now was as good as ever.  Things did not start off well.  First; the music was so LOUD!  Some poor old lady walked in and covered her ears the second the door opened.  I also hated the peanut shells.  It was stupid; poorly executed and had no business being in a fast food burger joint.  Steakhouse or BBQ place; maybe; but not here.  Apparently the ordering system is difficult because it took the 6 or so people in front of us forever to order; but for us smart folk; it takes about 30 seconds.  Now to the food.  It costs 4.89 for a single patty bacon cheeseburger.  I can get a Baconator combo at Wendy's for that price.  That's just the burger here; so for an extra 2.59 I can get frys (a generous portion at least) and another couple bucks gets me a drink.  I'm practically pushing a 10 dollar combo here!  This is fast food right?  I couldn't help but compare it to In'N'Out and this place was failing miserably!  Our food came out in roughly 5-8 minutes and we went outside to eat because the music was unbearably loud.  The frys were decent; nothing to special and I found the cajun fries to be very dry feeling in my mouth.  The burger was such a disappointment.  It was small and very smashed when I opened it.  The meat was very well done; and not juicy like they said it should be.  The bacon was decent and the cheese was well; cheese.  Overall; a pretty lame burger; especially for nearly 5 bucks!  Obviously; I was disappointed.  I know 5 bucks for a burger isn't a lot; but for fast food; it really is.  It's a shame that our President hasn't had the joy of experiencing decent burgers; because this place is not good.  This place is definitely a fail for me; but at least my food was edible.,ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,Holy overpriced!

We went with some friends that like it.  My wife is an In-n-Out fan; but for the record I wouldn't say I LOVE In-n-Out; but it's okay.  They are more hype than food to me; honestly.  Use that as your comparison to what I say here.  On to Five Guys...  Their investment in marketing is brilliant: 1 font; 2 colors: red/white.  This is a no frills place.  Don't expect to see a lot of flare here.  Red/White is all you get.  Their menu is easy.  Burger; Cheeseburger; Bacon Burger; Hot Dog (other stuff for kids).  All toppings are free.  So if you wanted a green-chile-bacon-bbq burger with onions and relish...you can get it at the same price as a bacon burger.    If there is a line and you don't know what you want; do us all a favor and step out of line.  This is a fast paced place and process orders pretty quick; so move along okay!  I got a burger and hot dog.  Hey you have to try both right?  I'll start with the dog.  Now any of you that put ketchup on your hot dog; stop reading and buy a flight to New York...you'll notice that is not allowed.  Dogs are onion/relish/mustard.  Done.  Five Guys splits their dogs down the center for faster cooking -- I LOVE this idea and already incorporated it in my own dog cooking for the kids.  The dog was a dog...good; and exactly what I expected -- was it the BEST?  No.  But it was what it advertised.  The burger -- my first attempt was onion; hot sauce.  It wasn't that great.  My ONLY complaint about these burgers is the meat itself needs more flavor.  Put some salt on those bad boys would you.  Knowing that though; understand that your burger will essentially taste like what you put on it.  If you want a plain burger; I'm positive you'll be disappointed.  My second try (not the same visit; c'mon I'm not that bad...well maybe; but not this time) I went for bacon burger with BBQ sauce and onion (note: I don't like cheese).  It was much better than my first experience.  Still wish the meat was seasoned.  Fries -- disappointing to me on first visit.  I saw \cajun fries\"" and said yum.  It's not really...it's regular fries with some sprinkle seasons.  They can do better here.  And based on the acclaimations that hang all over the place they have to some people.  I need to give the fries a second chance.  They are skin on fries though and perhaps cut to thick for my taste is what the problem is.  I like crispy fries;not soggy.  If I wanted a baked potato; I would have got one; so give me FRIES.  So why the 4 star rating?  Well if Yelp would allow half stars it'd be 3.5.  For me though; I liked this place better than In-n-Out.  If I want a better-than-fast-food burger that I can see being made and get it made-to-order; I think this will be my place.  If you want to try the dog/burger -- get the SMALL burger with your dog -- it's big enough. Trust me.  No shakes at this place though...straight up normal soda fountain.  My son had the grilled cheese (or 'girl cheese' as he calls it) and loved it.  They flip a burger bun inside out...clever.""",ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,"Yeah; it was high quality beef; but the fries were overpriced and mushy; got so many orders wrong I just enjoyed my free bacon and ask for more mustarrd and lettuce. I still like Carl's Jr sandwich with no bun; and wrapped in lettuce for fast food; and Joes Farm Grill is worth the drive for many many reasons. It was nice; but very self serving since all the decor was of the \LOOK we are awesome\"" $24 for 2 burgers fries and a drink is great. (and the bun couldnt hold up the bread; which was kinda weird; it just decenigrated. Friendly folks; Diet Mr Pibb; good music; and... overall; I recomend it if yur in the area and want a step up from drive through.)  The big deal is free condiments; but they were all sorta spartan and bland; even when I ask for a stupidly huge amount of stuff If I find myself back there; I'll ask for well done fries and see is that helps""",ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,After visiting this location and the one in Scottsdale near where I live; I have to say this chain is just OK. It's a tad overpriced; and the food is good; but it's too much for a place that doesn't even bring the food to your table. Fries; burger and a drink came to $11-something! Yikes. If I were craving a burger; I'd head to Red Robin instead of this place. My credit card was hacked the day after I went here too. Coincidence? Probably; but that left a bad taste in my mouth!,ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,"So... let me tell you that I will always be and forever be an In-N-Out fan; my stopping by Five Guys was based solely on curiousity on why this burger joint was the favorite of President Obama. As I was driving down Val Vista last night; I happened upon seeing a five guys location; and at first thought it was closed because there weren't any cars parked by it but I saw the open signs; and had passed through the intersection so I had to flip-a- bitch to get back to the Dana Park Plaza. For a burger joint with national acclaim... you would think it would attract the same kind of traffic that one is accustomed with at In-N-Out but sadly not... although it was a Tuesday night so maybe it was an off night.   Walked into the store and it had the similar boards of In-N-Out in the store but not the same layout... where at In-N-Out has the look of a diner with booth seats and swivel chairs and the like; here it was signs galore advertising the greatness of Five Guys it was like Five Guys glorification with all the different accolades from news publications and food critics. And it was faux wood tables and chair with high tops too. But it's the signs that get you; they're on the walls; hanging above the counters... signs; signs; and more signs. I think a little more modesty would be best but if this is how Five Guys wishes to market their brand that's their perogative... I like a clean simple look.   Ok; so back to ordering my food. I had to ask what the difference was between a regular burger and a little burger... I was thinking patty size but was told that the regular was a double and the little was a single. I ordered a regular cheeseburger and was told that all the toppings were free in addition to; so in a way I liked that I could add all the topping without being charged an additional 50 cents but still; the price of the cheeseburger was pricey at close to $6; I also ordered a side of the regular fries. Wait wasn't long and since it was close to closing; I was able to score some additional fries. I did notice something that five guys was lacking and that was milkshakes. Milkshakes are awesome to have with a burger; and if In-N-Out and Smashburger have them why can't Five Guys have them too? But I digress.   The meal itself. So... I remember reading one sign that said; \best fries around...\"" Tried the fries and yea... they're really good! In-N-Out fries are lacking; they're on the small side and sometimes tend to get soggy barely 20 mins later; it's the type of fry that must be consumed soon. Five guys on the other make a really good fry; it has good seasoning and a slight crisp; not too crispy; and some limp to it... it's like a medium fried fry if that exists. It was good... and if I ever come back; I'd be back for an order of fries. As for the burger; a sign said; \""A taste of heaven in a bun...\"" yea... that's pushing... it's not heaven... with all my toppings of grilled onions; grilled mushrooms; lettuce; tomato; pickle and bbq sauce with the double patty and the cheese it was a stuffed burger but it wasn't like OMG this burger is bomb kinda experience. Maybe I'm spoiled by the slightly toasted buns at In-N-out and my animal style cheeseburger with the thousand island... my five guys cheeseburger can't compare. It's good but not great and yes... it's filling but not worth $6! So with the cheeseburger and fries; my total came out out to $8.64. Pricey compared to In-N-Out... where a #2 (cheeseburger; fries and drink) comes out to under $3 and add in my animal style with my neopolitan shake... it still comes out to around $5. So price comparison... In-N-Out is the cheapest; burger comparison; In-N-Out again; and fries... well Five Guys wins that. Overall appeal; and crave factor... yea... it's still In-N-Out for me...

I was blown away by their soda machines with touch screen; very futuristic. The cup was fries was enough for 2 people and the burgers were large; juicy; fresh; and full of flavor. They would be a 5 stars if their prices were 1 dollar less. But overall I would gladly return very good food.,ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,The first time I went here I had a bad experience. The burger was super greasy and the fries were cold and soggy. So I decided to give it a shot again. The burger was a little better this time; but still dripping with grease. And again the fries were cold and soggy. And if you plan on eating here make sure you the only thing you have planned after is to go home to take a shower. You and you cloths are going to smell like greasy food. For paying close to $15 for a burger; fries; and a drink you would think for you enjoy your meal. And it would be very expensive for a family to dine here. The service wasn't very friendly; and it's way to loud to have a conversation with anyone.

Don't get me wrong; the burgers here are good but a cheeseburger; regular fries and a regular drink for over $13 buck??  Imagine if i brought my family of 5 to this fast food burger joint and having to spend over $65. Are you kidding me?? The burgers better have foie gras on it and the fries sprinkled with triffles!   In-n-out burgers are just as good if not better but you can spend less than half of what five guys charges.  Is it because they give you all the fries than most humans can eat (not necessary); which by the way; need to be cooked just a bit longer.  I think the appeal to most people is the fact that they have so many toppings to choose from and you can customize it like you want.  To me it's all about the burger meat itself and while it was ok; it did not blow my mind.  Cut the price in half and yes it would justify and would probably earn more returning customers.,ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,"I eat here often; it is near my house; I like the burgers; and the fries; but I cannot rate it better because :  The price.

That is more than if I had went to Ruby Tuesdays and had a triple prime; which I love.  My other complaint is the packaging. The brown bag does not cut it. It makes the food messy and hard to extract because they pile the fries on. The peanut thing is kinda gross as well; anything that is Communal typical means dirty.  The music is always good; I never ate there where I would describe it as \blaring\"" like one reviewer; and I am a pretty quiet person.

I met him at the Val Vista location today for lunch with my 4 month old and he brought his 6 year old.    As always; the place was very clean; and although it was lunchtime on a weekend; we were through the line quickly (must have been before the Mormons got out of services).  We both ordered cheeseburgers and his son got a grilled cheese; along with a large order of regular fries.  My buddy loves CheesburgerCheeseburger; so I was anxious to hear how FG compares.  He took his first bite and had a very suprisingly pleased look on his face.  The double patty cheeseburger; complete with plenty of accoutrement; was jucy and flavorful. After a previously distatetful experience with the cajun fries; the regular fries are absolutly superior.    The staff at this location gets extra points for checkin in on us (they knew we had a first timer on our hands) and going the extra mile.  I wanted my friend to check out the cajun fries; but they didn't have any cooked up; so they just gave us some spice to put on the extra fries that we had.  Then; they called the 6 year old over to the counter and gave him a WHOLE NEW FRESH bag of cajun fries.  \We didn't have any samples for you; so we decided to just cook you up a whole batch.\""  Seriously awesome service!    Sure; the lunch for 2.5 of us cost $25; and I'd only really go for something special; but I have a feeling every visit will be quite excellent!""",ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,Second time through yesterday...  Down grading my review.  There is nothing that stands out to make this place better than just another burger.    I ordered with different toppings. Stayed simple with Bacon; mushrooms; and of course jalapenos.. Order fries and a drink.  $12.00..    It was just a burger.  It was o.k. but not worth the $12.00 price. Honestly; Wendy's goes down better for me. Fries are just not doing it for me. I ordered regular. Added lot's of salt and ketchup and that helped.  It must be a taste thing; I just like my fries crispy.  I would still go back if in the area and wanting a burger.  But will also favor the In & Out or other places if I am going that direction instead.,ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,I saw a story on the TV about this place and decided to give it a try. It was a good burger. It is bit pricey but oh well. It was juicy and had good flavor and the fries were tasty too. Not reinventing the wheel by any means but my burger tasted good and that's what it's all about.,ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,I hate to admit it; but I like 5 guys better than In-n-Out.  I'm a Cali native and grew up on In-n-Out and I wanted nothing more than to say that 5 guys sucked and didn't compare.  Even though it is way over priced; the burgers are awesome and the fries are dope.,ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,"Let me start off by saying; I walked in to this establishment wanting to give this place 5 stars.  I want it to succeed.  I wanted a damn good burger.  I've eaten Five Guys before on the east coast.  I am no stranger to their wonderful concept.  Fresh products and amazing taste at a reasonable price.  I've eaten some amazing burgers at other Five Guys places.  Every burger you order is a double.  It says on the menu \cheeseburger\"" but it's a double cheeseburger.  Also a large fry will feed 2 (I'll get to that later)  Also all the toppings are included in the price.  Their toppings are about as generous as Subways toppings.  Plenty of variety.  Both the wife and I had a bacon cheeseburger with grilled onions and mushroom; lettuce and mayo and ketchup.  It's about a 10 minute wait for your food.  They have peanuts to keep you entertained while you wait.    As I rip into this greasy bag of goodness; I notice that my burger looks terrible.  I mean worse that any burger I have ever had at an greasy fast food joint.  The bottom bun is ripped to shreds; the toppings are falling everywhere including the meat and cheese.  Did the cook miss and not bother to fix his mistake?  At first I thought they served me a single burger but then under all the cheese I see another patty the size of a silver dollar.  I was so hungry and with my family; I was not in the mood to complain (oh and I can complain) I ate that burger in pieces because it was impossible to pick up.  I was so sad.  My wifes burger was fine.  She loved it but has had better.  The fries are the only reason Five Guys got 2 stars.  They are fresh cut and cooked to perfection.  Best part about them; they fill up the container then add an additional scoop in the bottom of the bag.  Overall; I am going to give this place one more shot.  One more opportunity to show me why this place is Zagat rated.  If it doesn't you better believe this time I am going to get my money back.  Let me know how your experience went here.  I hope it was an isolated incident.""",ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,My first time trying Five Guys and  I was told that this place would rival In 'n Out. I found it hardpress to believe since In n Out--come on...unless you're Shake Shack you can't compete.   I think what Five Guys has over In n Out is the fact that they have a ton of toppings you can add for free - my favourites being grilled mushrooms and fresh jalapeo pepper (SO SPICY). I also added lettuce; tomatoes; onions (They have grilled and raw); and pickles- it ended up being a pretty big burger; even though I ordered the small. In fact; the small is pretty filling regardless. The difference between the regular and the small is simply the number of patties. The regular size gives you two.  I like their fries better than in n out's but it was waaaay too salty; especially the cajun fries; was is just their regular fries sprinkled with an abundance of cajun seasoning. Get the small portion and you'll be good. If you get the regular you won't finish. If you get the large; they put a giant cup in your bag and then fill the BAG with fries. You'll have fries coming out of your ears.  The price is actually not that cheap. My water and my small burger worked out to be $8. I would say that In-n-Out definitely wins on all levels except for the quantity of ingredients available. But this place is still good.  I am; however; disappointed that they have no milkshakes.,ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,My first time trying Five Guys and  I was told that this place would rival In 'n Out.

I kept driving buy Five Guys on the Way to California Pizza Kitchen and I always wanted to try it out. So we decided to try it this evening.  The atmosphere is fantastic. They give peanuts out for free and you can throw the shells on the floor; so the kids had a blast. The soda machine is really cool too. Like nothing I've ever seen with a huge selection of different drinks. You really have to see it.  First off I thought it was a little expensive.  The hamburger was a little under cooked but even so the taste was eh. I've had much better and I haven't tasted much worse.  They give you a heaping order of fries and they tasted ok but nothing special.  One thing that struck me was how really uninterested their employees seem to be.  Most places are making a better effort of greeting you; asking you how things are; and saying goodbye. There is obviously no training or effort to great customers or treat them friendly in any way.  My kids had a blast and they loved it but we won't be going back.,ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,A good place if you want a decent burger. Wouldn't say it is the best burger I have ever had; however; it is tasty and hearty and the veggies (lettuce; tomato; etc) always taste fresh. I like that large amount of toppings to choose from. Prices are decent for what you get. A tip: I have heard that their regular burgers are huge so I always order the Jr burger and its more than enough. Also; the smalls fries are basically like a large at most other places so i don't even wanna picture what the large looks like. Atmosphere is clean and service is pretty quick. Like I said; a decent place for a burger in this neck of the woods.,ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,"For a gal who's not a huge fan of red meat; Five Guys has made a burger lover out of me.  I've been to two locations - the one on Val Vista; and just yesterday I visited the new one in the food court at Scottsdale Fashion Square.  Both have been awesome!  Like I said; I'm not normally a burger eater.  But my boyfriend is a Five Guys fan; and his son has recently developed a taste for cow.  So I decided to be a good sport and give it a try.  I have to say; one of the things I love most about Five Guys is that you can get any & all toppings added for free.  Yep; FREE.  Now; the burgers aren't exactly cheap; but still; free toppings are a nice perk.  The place is very casual - you order from the counter; and they call your number when it's ready.  I ordered the \junior\"" cheeseburger; which was pretty darn big!  The regular burgers have two patties; so make sure you're really hungry if you order one.  I added lettuce; ketchup; mustard; mayo; grilled onions; and pickles to mine.  Yum!  It's a good thing they wrap the burgers in foil so you can unwrap a little at a time - the toppings fall out otherwise!  We got fries the first time we went; and they were awesome; but this time we knew we probably wouldn't have room; so we just stuck with the burgers.  In summary: the buns were soft; the meat was perfectly cooked; and we all left with full bellies and smiles on our faces.  For a simple burger joint; you can't ask for much more than that.  :)""",ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,"Yeah. Super pricey. Over $14 bucks for a greasy poorly made sloppy burger; with two stale 4\ burger patties. A large drink (the highlight of the visit was they had MELLO YELLO) and some extra salty fries.  Will not go back. Chuckbox has ALWAYS been the place.""",ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,People (staff) were great: No problem at all in that departmentl.  The burger was ...eh....okay; however; for the price; I would rather go to a regular sit-down location; like a Red Robin.  There; the burgers are high-end; the seating is pleasant and the price; for the food; is more reasonable (relative to what you get and the taste).,ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,"My wife summed it best: \This tastes like a Costco burger\"". Translation: go to Costco; buy some buns; some frozen patties. Grill the patties; add cheese; favorite toppings; and you have a burger that tastes like a Five Guys burger. Nothing special.  To the more faithful; I'll be deemed a heretic. But I was told that Five Guys was \""better than In-n-Out\"". I go to In-N-Out at least once a week. I own 2 t-shirts. I love In-N-Out. But I'm not so religious that I'm unwilling to try another burger that could be better. I went to delux burger; and was rewarded with a innovative; great tasting burger.. I was hoping Five Guys would give me that same experience.  Nope. Not even close. Five Guys is not as good as In-N-Out; and it's more expensive. The fries are good; thick cut; seasoned and fried right; great with ketchup. But the burger was average. The bread tasted manufactured; the toppings generic. The tables are cramped; squeezed close together.  Eating as a family of 5; I had to put my bag of fries on the floor: no space left on the table. Chairs and people stick out the narrow aisles between tables make getting a refill a dangerous mission . No drive thru to bypass inside. Not my kind of place.

Sorry In and out is definitely outclassed by this place.,ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,Pretty tasty; hearty burger with natural cut fries but; overall; nothing really special about this place. The inside looks just like In-N-Out with signs covering the walls proclaiming all the positive reviews around the states it's received - almost like they're trying to pressure you into liking it. Well; it's great that the Washington Post really liked your burger; but this is Arizona and it's nothing new.  The lady got my dad's burger wrong. She and the rest of the staff seemed a bit rushed - it was busy but I'd rather wait for a burger done right than have it rushed through. Dad changed his mind on cheese and never asked for bacon but got both. At least we didn't get charged for them? Burgers came wrapped in tin-foil (mine was also double-wrapped... ok?) and the fries were in a cup; all came in a bag like carry-out whether or not we ate inside. If you think In-N-Out is completely over rated (and it really is) and don't mind not having a drive-thru; this might be an alternative for you. Instead of In-N-Out's super thin burgers and fries; you get two hand-formed patties with free toppings (I got grilled onions and bar-b-que sauce; though both bacon and cheese will cost you) on a normal sesame seed bun. Their fries are also thicker and naturally cut with a nice seasoning.  I spent $20 on two burgers; a reg. size fry; and two sodas. Pricey for fast food style lunch.

If you want a really good burger and fries - and don't mind paying for it - then this place is recommended. Lots of \free\"" toppings for your burger (built into the price) and very fresh fries amply served. A bit on the pricey side as far as burger joints are concerned; but it is a step up in quality from most fast-food joints; and the food was delicious.

On our visit; the AC was broken; and they had a rediculous swamp cooler generating 95% humidity.  As far as the food.  What the heck is the big deal.  They were terrible.  The frys were terrible and way over priced.  The only thing my wife liked were the peanuts.  They were free.  We would never go back under any condition or for any reason.  Simply TERRIBLE.,ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,Amazing burgers and great service plus enough fries to feed an army! Sure; the price is a bit higher than most places but the only burgers in town that hold a candle to Five Guys are Culvers and Rumbi.,ahKN6wh6z2vZsd8C7AyG5A,Great Burgers! Really fun place to stop by for a burger. Everything is fresh; well prepared and a lot of options for toppings and prep. The double burger is ridiculous! A little pricey compared to In-N-Out right next door.,8SvCSiGwtaGL2Z78tRSSlQ,One of the Best Fast Food Burgers Around.   Im not typically a burger person.  However; occasionally I get a craving and Five Guys always hits the spot.  Five Guys is a chain burger restaurant but unlike any other.  The burgers at Five Guys are always fresh;hot; and juicy.  The burgers are tender; tasty; and well seasoned. In addition; to great burgers are Five Guys Fries.  Do not order a large order of fries.  The large of fries  is not large it is enormous; it is a lunch bag full of fries.  My nephew; sister and I barely made a dent in them.  Five Guys burgers are the closest you will come to burgers you cooked yourself.  Five guys allows you to  customize your burger with cheese; bacon; grilled onions; mushroons; and to many other toppings to name.   If customizing your burger isn't enough; you can do the same with your drinks.  Five Guys soda fountain  has every coke product from mello yello to dasani water. You select your base soda and and then add flavors  like cherry; peach; or lime.  So you can customize your drink as much as your burger.      Prices are reasonable; employees are friendly and accommodating;  and the service is quick.,8SvCSiGwtaGL2Z78tRSSlQ,Went to Five Guys for dinner. On our way there; I placed an order on my phone to speed up the process a bit. When we arrived; there were a few people in line. We walked over to the pickup counter and let them know we had placed an online order. They had the ticket and said our food would be ready soon. The guy handed us our cups and we went over to the Coca Cola Freestyle machines to get our drinks. I got the Peach Sprite. Love that combination! Went to use the restroom and then just a couple minutes later our food was ready. The online ordering probably saved us about 5 minutes. I had the Little Cheeseburger (1 patty... if you haven't been here; know that the Regular is 2 patties) with lite ketchup/mustard/pickles (sometimes they overdo the ketchup); and split a regular fry with my boyfriend; which was plenty because they fill up the cup and dump even more fries into the bag. Their fries are so good! Skins on; hot; and crisp on the outside yet soft on the inside. It's what I envision home cooked fries to be like. The burger also reminds me of something I'd want to make at home. The only thing I don't really like about Five Guys is how loud the music is... usually a mix of Classic Rock and Alternative. Also the burgers are $6+ so don't expect a cheap meal; but it'll be worth it!,8SvCSiGwtaGL2Z78tRSSlQ,First time at Five Guys today on Litchfield Rd.  I was greeted properly by the young lady at the counter which is always a good start.  She asked me if I had eaten there and I told her it was my 1st time; and she politely helped me through the menu options.  Good service for sure.  The burger was delicious; nothing incredibly different; however Five Guys give you options for your toppings and they have them all it seems.  The fries were cooked well- but were too salty in my opinion.  Plus I ordered a large fry; and there were too many too eat!  Not like that's a bad thing; but a medium fry would probably suffice for two people here. Five Guys also has the new soda dispensary system where you can choose on a digital screen what you would like to drink.  I love these things mostly cause you can get any flavor mixed into your lemonade which is fantastic!  Lastly the price.  It wasn't inexpensive.  I paid about $12 for the meal; which for a burger and fries is kind of pricey.  I would return to Five Guys; but mostly for the burger which was the highlight of my meal.  Nothing out of the ordinary; but a solid lunch none the less and I enjoyed my first meal at Five Guys.,8SvCSiGwtaGL2Z78tRSSlQ,First time at Five Guys today on Litchfield Rd.

We got there right as they opened because they fill up pretty fast.  The music inside was way too loud.  Practically had to shout to have a conservation.  The burgers were ok; you could tell the meat was fresh.  If you like Wendy's burgers you'll like this place.  A bit pricey; over $20 for two burgers; one order of fries; (huge serving; feeds 2); and 2 sodas.  Again burgers aren't bad just not worth the price.,8SvCSiGwtaGL2Z78tRSSlQ,I was so excited to eat here. Until I paid. $25 for 2 burgers and fries and a sodas. It was crazy loud inside so we ate outside. Soda was one step away from flat. My burger looked like it was attack by a spatula then hidden by a soggy bun. My mushy fries were over salted to the point where all I could taste was salt. Not impressed and we will not be returning. In N Out is way better and priced right.,8SvCSiGwtaGL2Z78tRSSlQ,What is not to love.  An appetizer of peanuts for and then burgers that are fresh and full of good ingredients.  I always share the regular fry with a friend it's just too much for a single person. Love the soda machines!! I look forward to coming back again soon.  Always good service; definitely cannot complain... Prices for 2 to eat the single burger; share a fry; and a drink was $17.. Not cheap..but if you want quality products you're going to pay for it.,8SvCSiGwtaGL2Z78tRSSlQ,What is not to love.

Large fries are enough for 2 or more people and the burgers are pretty good.  Kind of like the ones hot off your grill at home.  Kind of pricey so if you aren't prepared for $20+ for 2 persons then stick with I/O or Freddy's but overall really good.  This place was loud and I even asked to have it turned down and they happily obliged.,8SvCSiGwtaGL2Z78tRSSlQ,This place was way overpriced for the food you get.  With the exception of the fries- they did give us a lot of fries; for a medium order. I found them dry; and strongly tasted of potato skin though.    My son ordered the bacon burger; there was no bacon; and the burger was small for the $6 it cost.  My daughter had the grilled cheese with some toppings; they left off the tomato (her favorite part).  Yes; I could have gone up and asked them to correct the order; but they were super busy and it took forever to get our food in the first place.   My husband got the blt.  Nothing special about it. I got the regular single patty burger; just ok.  My family and I agreed that we won't go back.  We actually prefer other fast food burger places that give you more for your money.,8SvCSiGwtaGL2Z78tRSSlQ,This place was way overpriced for the food you get.

Okay.  LOVED the toppings and that they were included in the price.  Burger was only so-so.  Menu needs to clarify that if you want a single; order the small burger as the larger burgers are doubles.  3.  Fries - Five Guy's fries broke my husband's heart.  They showed such promise; coming out in a nice cup;; very similar to how fries (and poutines) come out at most chip stands in his home province.....and then one bite and you just knew -they were under cooked.  We each had 1 or 2 fries and then had to declare them D.O.A.    4.  Grilled cheese - loved that this option was available; but pretty steep cost for a bun turned inside out with a piece of american cheese.  I am giving 2 stars only because I have heard so much good about this restaurant since they came to Goodyear - but we won't be back.,8SvCSiGwtaGL2Z78tRSSlQ,I have heard many friends rave about Five Guys; so our family decided to give it a try one night.

I was very pleased and glad FG's is now here!  To me the meat wasn't greasy as fresh; not frozen meat which will always be juicier and have more flavor.  The fries are very good; note the \small fry\"" is plenty for 2+ people! Sure it's not cheap; but when is a quality product?

Oh; love the Coke Freestyle machines!""",8SvCSiGwtaGL2Z78tRSSlQ,A lot better than In and Out burgers if you ask me. Gets a little expensive when your ordering for the whole family and adding drinks and fries to that; but totally worth it. Fresh lettuce and tomatoes; quality ingredients is what you're paying for. Plus I love all the different options when choosing your fountain drink.,8SvCSiGwtaGL2Z78tRSSlQ,We've only grabbed it to go which in my opinion is the better option; you don't have a ton of space.    Burgers were delicious; definitely living up to the hype I've heard from others.  Price point isn't too bad and serving sizes are generous.  We have a family of 4 and split 2 orders of fries with plenty left over.  It will probably replace In and Out as our go to burger place near the house.,8SvCSiGwtaGL2Z78tRSSlQ,You get what you pay for. Very expensive.,8SvCSiGwtaGL2Z78tRSSlQ,Kind of small and a little pricey but excellent food! Sends me into a food coma everytime!,8SvCSiGwtaGL2Z78tRSSlQ,Pricey; but the food is really good.  Order the cajun fries they are awesome.  The service was friendly; but the music was really; really loud.  So loud that you could not talk to the person at your table without yelling.  I would eat here again but would have to wait for the summer to be over to sit outside away from all the loud music.,8SvCSiGwtaGL2Z78tRSSlQ,I don't review burger places.. unless if one of those times when I do. I have tried five guys one time; long ago.. and now I did it again. It wasn't my idea; but I did go along with it. 'Nuff excuses.  So I ordered a burger. No cheese; no bacon but with grilled onions. Apparently did my selective memory forget that a burger is a double burger. This makes it trickier to eat. Oh; yes it does.   Five Guys is an attempt to make fast food burger joint to be a little bit more than a fast food burger joint; without having anything special to back that claim up. Now the burgers here are fine. I do like them; but the cost-increase is not justified. I have heard some people truly rave about this place; but it is the same'ol; same'ol burger place that has developed since the 50'ies. The burgers are good; as they are in many other places. But it's only a burger.. not a magical burger; not a meal-o'meat extraordinaire - just a tasty burger. Nothing more.   Other good-tasting-burger-places you can have a good craft beer and a waitress fetching you all your wishes; but at five guys it is only the burger.. the rest is standard chain BS. I do believe they have better meat and condiments than the chain-burger-place; but then again.. I feel I have beaten this horse enough.   Good burger. Only. Nothing more. No beer. Sad face.   Need a tip? - Have a better burger at a place that serve beer.,yqTromUJgF6Ll7VVo4iF0A,Heard nice things about Five Guys and tried to go while I was in Portland but didn't make it. I found out about the new location in Surprise and paid a visit.    I went on a Saturday about 12:30 which was probably a mistake. The place was packed and it took about 25 minutes to get my order. You could hardly hear the numbers called because of the music and crowd noise.   The food tasted ok but is a bit messy to eat. It has good portions but I paid $13.13 for the bacon/ cheese burger with large fries; no drink; so it's a bit spendy. It's probably not a place I would go to again. In/out burger is quicker; cheaper and is not as messy to eat; so I'll stick with them in the future.,yqTromUJgF6Ll7VVo4iF0A,Good old fashion burgers with any and all the toppings that you could imagine.  They give your more fries (seasoned or plain) than anyone should be allowed to eat and you can have your choice of just about any coke flavor that you could think of.  They have a self serve soda machine that has about 120 different flavors of anything from Coke; Diet Coke; Sprite; etc and then on top of that you can any flavor to your soda.  Nice.  The only negatives that I can think of is that the music is WAY to loud.  I love music; don't think I'm an old prude but I found that it was impossible to chat with the people I was eating with.  Secondly - this place is really expensive.  My wife and I ate there and had just the normal stuff; burgers; fries and soda.  Cost = $23 and change.  We can go to just about any other burger joint and have the same thing for about $10 less for the same thing.  Just saying.,yqTromUJgF6Ll7VVo4iF0A,Good old fashion burgers with any and all the toppings that you could imagine.

Its is very simple you walk in get a hamburger if you tell them what you want one two or three patties tell them what else you want off the menu to put on your burger and that it not very difficult. Burger Fries  I think they do have a a hot dog or something on the menu but you really go there for the burger and fries.  Fries are awesome !  They have stacks of potatoes lined up as  you walk in and stand next to them in line. When they run out someone comes and grabs a bag so they can freshly cut those bad boys and then into the deep fryer they go.  I did try my fries with malt vinegar for the first time ever and the taste just explodes in my mouth. Mouth is watering as I write this..... I do also love how they have the fancy soda machine. This machine rocks because I do get my Cherry Ginger Ale. And that makes me happy.  So when I crave these mouthwatering fries I will know where to go. 5 Guys Burgers and Fries.  Um the prices are a bit high. So I can tell you that I will crave fries more than the burger;,yqTromUJgF6Ll7VVo4iF0A,Yes it is very good. Yes it is too expensive for what you get. However; if I'm in the mood for a juicy delicious burger and fries as a once and a while thing and not an everyday thing; I would much rather have the $10 burger and fries here than at applebees around the corner.,yqTromUJgF6Ll7VVo4iF0A,This is a really great place to eat.  The fries with vinegar are awesome.  Only thing that sucks is the price.  But sometimes you just gotta go for it and enjoy,yqTromUJgF6Ll7VVo4iF0A,Service is good. Staff were very nice. The wait was not long. But the prices are completely insane. No combos whatsoever. Every item you have to order separately.. 6.40 for a cheeseburger. I thought it would be a really huge cheeseburger for the price. It's not. Fries were good but also overpriced. Just blown away by dropping $20 for my son and I to have two cheeseburgers; 2 reg sodas and share a fry. Culvers is way better and half the price.,yqTromUJgF6Ll7VVo4iF0A,This was my first time at 5 guys.  After hearing how great it is;  I just had to try it.  Boy was I disappointed!  First off i had a bit of sticker shock at the prices. Don't mind paying for quality food but  $27.00 for 2 burgers;  2 drinks & 1 large fries is  a bit much . Okay maybe it is just that good...NOT! I ordered a bacon cheese double; the bun was stale & although the burger was just cooked it was not hot enough to melt the cheese. I ordered grilled onions & mushrooms; they were cold.  This would have been tolerable if the burger had any flavor.  Let's get to the fries; I love fresh cut fries with the skin when they are cooked properly; which these were not & did i mention all the salt. There was so much salt that my throat was burning;  would have been nice if they had used some of that salt on the meat.  The ac was cranked so low i almost needed a jacket;  this helped to make my fried get cold super fast.  The staff was courtious other then the guy behind the counter that thought it was karaoke  time and was not shy about singing to the music.  For another employee to start sweeping the floor while i was eating was also unacceptable.  I drove past 3 other burger places  to go here ; wish I would have stopped at another place. I gave 1 star only because I could not give a negative  number of them.,yqTromUJgF6Ll7VVo4iF0A,If you are a burger lover this is your place; but prepare to spend a little bit more comparing to other fast food places. Have in mind that Five Guys is indeed a high quality juicy burgers and of course endless french fries with the skin. The only thing to consider in this location is the hours that people go to this place; what I mean is this place became so popular in the area that it can be full sometimes. My recommendation is visit it after 2:00pm or in the evening hours not late than 9:30pm. They have a great costumer service; is family friendly; and of course delicious.,yqTromUJgF6Ll7VVo4iF0A,Everyone always says how amazing this place is across the country; so of course we had to try it out. The first one I went to was near Chicago; and it was okay. Then again; I don't really eat burgers (or fast food) all too often!  The Surprise location that just opened up; however; is not even comparable to the Chicago location we tried. My aunt really wanted to try it out; so we met her there during her lunch break and ordered some burgers and stuff. I don't remember it being that confusing to order before; but we were completely lost with all of the options/process and the people taking our orders were not very helpful. It was also extremely busy; but that was expected. However; some of the employees were extremely rude to other customers around us. They weren't rude to me personally; but I didn't like the way I saw a few of them speak to other customers. I thought I'd speak up for them; whether they realized it was happening or not! :P Some people are pretty oblivious; but employees shouldn't take advantage of that lol.  In my opinion; our orders were extremely simple. A few burgers and fries; nothing special about any of it. However; they took forever to get them out to us. The soda machines were pretty neat; but it was hectic trying to find the correct beverage with how busy the place was and the location of said soda machines. It was right in the way of the queue of people waiting for their orders; so it was also hard to tell who was waiting for what. It was also hard to hear which order numbers were being called; so I just stood right next to them waiting. I probably annoyed them; but oh well! Even then; I still could barely tell what order numbers they were calling out. I think they had a microphone to use; but they didn't seem to want to do that for some reason. (This is also one of the times I heard them being rude to other customers... this guy calling the numbers out called one customer's order two or three times; and the poor girls couldn't hear him. He finally got their attention and bitched at them for taking so long to get their order from him. I thought he was kidding with them at first; but the look on his face said otherwise.)  Overall; we weren't at all impressed with the price; the food (which was simply mediocre; nothing special); and service. Luckily I don't care about burgers because I'm not very American; but still... a disappointment for sure.,yqTromUJgF6Ll7VVo4iF0A,After hearing good things about Five Guys;  we thought we'd finally try their burgers.   Wow!   We were not expecting them to be as pricey as what they were but we don't mind paying if the food is good!  We received our food in a bag for dine in.  When my husband started to reach into the bag;  we noticed the fries had been put in the bag but some excess was just thrown on top of everything in the bag.  The outside of the foil wrapping on the burger was greasy.   There was definitely no flavor to the burger;  thank god I asked for cheese & bacon.   The burger itself wasn't warm enough to melt the cheese that was on it.   Then the fries were very under cooked and so salty we couldn't stand to finish them.  The restaurant was soo cold inside & if the music wasn't loud enough; there's a kid working in there that had no problem singing the songs loud enough for all to hear.  Then just as we are about done eating; one of the girls came around sweeping the floors.   Gross!  You're sweeping dirt & peanut shells & stirring up god knows what at the table right next to where I'm eating.  Really?   You couldn't wait until we were done?   I definitely won't be going back there!!!!,yqTromUJgF6Ll7VVo4iF0A,been here twice now; and the burgers are awesome.  i love the ability to build my own burgers on the phone APP at a stop light and then pick it up 15 minutes later.  the first time i went for some reason the order never got made but i only had to wait a few extra minutes and they got it for me (and the workers were VERY apologetic)   It;s close; good price; and good food; and i will keep going back,yqTromUJgF6Ll7VVo4iF0A,"Way over priced. The deal here is to fill you up on overloaded French Fry's. The bill for 2 burgers; 2 Frys; and 2 drinks was $28.00. Even eating in; they must treat it like take out because our order came in a brown bag. So we had no tray; basket; or plates. They put the burgers in the bottom of the bag and filled 6\ of French frys on top of it. Way more than any one person would want to eat. Each order of frys looked like the equivalent of 2 whole potatoes. The only good thing I could say was the burger by itself was very good. It was cooked just right. Juicy and flavorful. Still; the price can't be overlooked. $28.00 for 2 people is too much for a lunch of fast food""",yqTromUJgF6Ll7VVo4iF0A,"Not on my radar for a burger and fries craving.....First off be sticker shocked on the cost for a burger; yes I do get the larger one; but still to drop 10 bucks on a soda and burger is on the higher cost chart.

The cheese is always perfectly melted and the jalapeos I get are always tasting fresh. They have cool touch screen soda machines where you can add different flavors to any soda. My only complaint it the prices. It is a little pricy but worth it in my opinion,DScAYRPPKaqt1NBkCbibHg,Food and service was excellent! First time here and as I was deciding the worker never made me feel rushed. He welcomed the guest behind me as I continued to choose between beans or no beans. After he was finished with me; he instantly gave them the save positive attitude he gave me and apologized for the delay in assistance. Great service; great food; great price! COME TO HAWAII!,DScAYRPPKaqt1NBkCbibHg,I kind of have a love hate relationship with this place. I hate how much the food cost just for a burrito but I love not having to spend three hours in the bathroom afterwards. I hate the overly yuppie vibe but love the clean look of the restaurant. I.... well you get the idea! Growing up in the valley I was surrounded by mexican food places so I always wondered why someone would pay almost 7 dollars for something you could get for around 3? I guess it is the not having to worry about being shanked by someone in a parking lot in south phoenix or finding grandma's hair in your combo platter( it will make you wiser). All I know is that for me it is nice to have a place to eat if you do not want to gorge on a McNasty burger (I'm hating it!). Just wish they would dial back the hipster thing to 1995 GAP store levels (no I will not sign your petition!!) I get it you care about the earth; now can I please eat my food?,X1jTnU6c9eloN2Bxs78uTg,Went in at 4:30pm on a Saturday and no wait in line. I was already excited cause the chicken burrito cost a few cents less than my usual Chipotle location back in MA. Staff here was super friendly and they put generous portions. Chicken could've been cooked longer cause it was a little more chewy than in previous burritos I've had from Chipotle - and I've sure had plenty - but it was still good nonetheless.,X1jTnU6c9eloN2Bxs78uTg,Not quite understanding the low reviews here! I recently tried Chipotle for the very first time ever and you better believe I gobbled that burrito up like nobodies business. It was huge; delicious; and cheap. Sure; the guacamole is a bit on the steep side; but they served me tons and it was delicious; so I can manage. I can't believe i avoided this place so many times; I will definitely go back...like; tomorrow.,X1jTnU6c9eloN2Bxs78uTg,"When my kidnappers finally dropped me off in an alley; I cut off the rope and removed the duct tape from my mouth.  The afternoon sun dried my tears and my belly thought my throat had been cut.  It was not.  I was famished.  I mean; I could have eaten an ox; an elephant; a scabby dog; and a horse between two vans.  My captors took my wallet with identification; my keys; and my belt.  All I had on me was a ten dollar bill.  There is only one place that would accept me in this condition and feed me enough food for my survival.  It is time to man up and get in line at the Chipotle.  When I entered the restaurant;  the air conditioning was an immediate relief.  For the last few days; my only form of air conditioning was a Popsicle being waved in my face.  And then I heard music coming out of plywood walls.  The corrugated steel and concrete made me have flashbacks of my echoing warehouse prison I was detained in.  I had to stay brave and line up with the people that have not read any books about \Communist Russia\"" or \""The Grapes of Wrath\"".  We were all hungry; and evidently; we all forgot our wallets and purses and were forced to eat here with our ten dollar bills.  All of the employees were pissed off that they had to serve people food while wearing the same t-shirt for an entire week.  The air was permeated with beefgrease; and I imagine that odor clings to fabric.  It would be nice if companies that require dress codes gave their employees enough clothing for a week and not just one shirt... but then again; it would be nice if my pants were not falling off while I was trying to decide if I wanted three sloppy tacos or a drippy burrito.    I went with the drippy burrito; in order to not actually see what was going into my peckish gape.  The first thing the employees are eager to give you; is rice.  They will pile it on.  One heaping spoon was too much; but then she slapped on another small spoon too and smiled at me.  She was nice; and I was too hungry to tell her that she was taking up space for the real stuff.  I wasn't in a position to make a scene; although; in retrospect; everyone was already looking at me.  I was shuffling like a penguin down the assembly line because my ankles were still handcuffed together.  Jokes on them; I pawned those bad boys and got about as much as I paid for the Chipotle rice-filled burrito.  When I finally got a bite of beef; it was savored.  Not because it was prepared in a marinade and cooked to a mouth-watering perfection.  Because it had a piece of tough ligament or rubbery fat still attached.  Whatever.  I was hungry; and just spent the previous eight hours hogtied in the trunk of a car.  Don't judge.  It is really hard for someone to mess up a burrito that you tell them how to make.  I feel privileged enough now to write reviews on Yelp about all of the amazing artisans; small businesses; and kitchens that help make Phoenix a vibrant place to live and eat.  Mexican food is as diverse as the people and landscape that the food comes from.  When companies act as the face of an entire cultural experience in the exact same way all over the world; negative stereotypes are formed about Mexican food.  Chipotle; a company that brands itself  as a Mexican eatery is more representative of flavors and products that can be eaten in a Taco Bell than eating from an eatery in Hermosillo or Nogales.  Unfortunately; every corner in Phoenix is being taken up by cookie-cutter prefab restaurants that replace genuine opportunities for families and bootstrap DIYers to make something out of our unique life experience while providing healthier; fresh; and local products.  I was once kidnapped.  It was that day that I learned my city was hijacked.  Eat at Tacos De Jaurez on 7th St and Portland or La Condessa on 16th St just north of McDowell instead of Chipotle for better food in a more relaxed and comfortable community atmosphere for about the same pricepoint.""",T93h3F_Mq8bdEWBEujsEcQ,"I was introduced to Togo's by my boyfriend; orginially from California. I love sandwiches so of course; I was excited to try a new place. It's about a 10 minute drive from his house (about 20 minutes from mine) so we decide to head over from his place on a sunday afternoon. To my delight; it just happens to be my favorite sandwich as the daily special (turkey and avocado). How awesome!! We decide to order two sandwiches each; one for now and then one for later since the prices are great for the daily special. The sourdough bread is great but a little hard to eat so if you're looking for a softer bread; I'd go with the parmesean. Similar to subway; you are able to add your own toppings but cheese is extra. Sandwiches are stuffed full of goodies and just thinking about it makes me want to eat one now!!  The only negative (for me at least) is that it seems to take a long time for them to make the sandwiches. So; if you're in a hurry; I'd call ahead to order or just plan to be there a little while.

Totally love and will keep coming back!!""",T93h3F_Mq8bdEWBEujsEcQ,"After being a Togos fan for many years I think our relationship has come to an end.  The last two visits to get 2 sandwiches to go were beyond terrible.    My husband's pastrami was so bad it ended up in the garbage.   It smelled rancid and there were really no pieces of meat; just crumbs.    My turkey/cranberry was also bad.   The \turkey\"" had no resemblance to the taste of turkey and the parmesan bread was so stale it was crumbly.  The price of the sandwiches do not reflect the quality of years gone by.  Might as well go to Subway.""",T93h3F_Mq8bdEWBEujsEcQ,I am so excited to FINALLY find Togo's!  I have not been able to find a decent sandwich shop since moving here from So Cal so imagine my surprise to stumble upon my favorite place from back home.  They have great portions and prices to match.  Needless to say I will be heading back to Togo's again very soon.,JbJDlfcnYiyZRXeHQcAVjg,I've been wanting to eat here since it opened and had high expectations from the new chicken joint on the block.  I was underwhelmed:  The strips themselves seem to be of higher quality than other places but the overall flavor just isn't there.  The fries; cole slaw; and toast are all pretty ok and nothing special.  Standard stuff.  The dipping sauce that some people rave about is also just ok.  It tastes almost like thick Italian dressing and marinara sauce mixed with a hint of ranch.  It is ok at best and is just weird with chicken strips.  The price is a bit high.  I got one of the meal deal things and it was almost 10 bucks.  Not horrible but not a stellar value either.  On the other hand; the drive through line was pretty fast during the lunch rush and the workers were friendly.  Anyway; the next time I feel like eating a junk-food-heart-attack for lunch I'm going down the street to Churchs.  Just give me some overly fried strips of cheap chicken with some ranch and I'm happy.,JbJDlfcnYiyZRXeHQcAVjg,I've been wanting to eat here since it opened and had high expectations from the new chicken joint on the block.

They were tender and just enough coating. The \secret\"" sauce had a little kick and was awesome.  The menu is simple so it doesn't take forever to decide what to order and the price is very reasonable.  My husband loves sweet tea and theirs tastes just like what you get in the South.""",JbJDlfcnYiyZRXeHQcAVjg,"Possibly the first AND last time here.  I had read about this place and thought that it was a cool concept....do one thing and do one thing well (chicken fingers).  I decided to stop here on my way down to the game.  I went through the drive through and placed my order.  I ordered \The Box Combo\"" which included 4 chicken strips; cole slaw; fries and a drink.  The price wasn't bad (under $7.00) and it sounded like it would be fantastic.  The drive through line took at least 10 minutes before I got my food.  Once I did get the goods; I pulled over; parked and dug in.  Here is how the food was............  Chicken Strips-  Meh!  The strips were a decent size but there were a couple of things working against them.     #1.  These things were WAY too hot.  I appreciate freshly made food but maybe you might want to let that shit sit for a minute and drain or something.  These were so hot you couldn't even eat them without burning your mouth.  Even after mouth breathing/cooling and sitting there for 10 minutes; my last strip was as scorching as the first!    #2.  I really didn't like the breading.  It is a really thin coating that is just a bit greasy.  The breading was kind of falling off in pieces and just seemed a bit \""off\"".     #3.  The taste of these things.  They were super duper plain jane.  It seemed like they could use a ton more seasoning and really didn't have any flavor.  The dipping sauce helped; but still didn't make up for the fact that these strips looked good but had no taste.  Were they the nastiest things I have ever had?  No.  Can I make just as good or better chicken strips at home?  Yep!  This is their niche and unfortunately I didn't think they were anything special.  I much prefer Popeyes strips...at least they have flavor!  Fries-  Standard crinkle cut fries.  They were ok.  Crispy but needed some more salt.  Cole Slaw- Didn't try it.  Texas Toast-  This was the best part of the meal.  Kind of reminded me of Sizzlers cheese toast but lesser quality (That is one thing Sizzler does better than anyone else....cheese toast.)  If I could have traded my fries and/or slaw for another slice; I would have done it.  Soda- Coke Zero tasted a little \""off\"".  I have had a few instances so far in Phoenix where fountain soda has tasted weird.  Don't know what it is but Raising Cane's Coke Zero is in the same boat.  Sauce- Their sauce is a mayo based sauce...I took a tiny taste and didn't like it.  I did pay extra to get some honey mustard.  Their honey mustard sauce is actually pretty good.  Service in the drive through was friendly.  Slow but friendly.  I personally probably won't come back but I can see myself ending up here eventually...my wife loves chicken strips and I'm sure she will want to try this place out and I will be forced here with her.  Meh; right?  We shall see................""",JbJDlfcnYiyZRXeHQcAVjg,Finally made it in to try this place; resisting In-N-Out across the street.  I went with Chicken Fingers; a cuplet of Cane's Sauce and Fries.  The menu is dinky here...  What I ordered is almost all they have except buns; soft drinks & cole slaw.  With that said; I found this place to be friendly; comfortable; inexpensive; & the food was REALLY GOOD!     :-))  Chicken Fingers 2 x $1.09; Cane's Sauce 29; Fries $1.59=$4.06,JbJDlfcnYiyZRXeHQcAVjg,They do have some good chicken fingers but other than that they are over-rated and over priced.  Their lemonade is excellent but they charge for refills.  Cane sauce was good.  Overall; I will not be a repeat customer.,JbJDlfcnYiyZRXeHQcAVjg,Love this place but they are a little overpriced!!! The sauce is what makes the chicken taste even better! Raising canes is fab. 4 stars due to prices!,JbJDlfcnYiyZRXeHQcAVjg,My friend had recommended that he enjoyed this place when he was in Vegas.  They finally brought the first franchise location out in the valley. Raising Cane is a paradise for any chicken fingers lover.  There are movie posters all around inside the restaurant and even in the bathroom area.  A disco ball above is rotating and reflecting light beams down while you place your order.  They have plenty of spaces for parking.  The chicken fingers were really crispy; but nothing too special.   I do like the Texas Toast.  As Norm mentioned; I wish it was more garlicky as well.  The coleslaw was far too wet for me.  I think the Cane's sauce was similar to one of Arby's sauce. I so wanted to give them more stars; however there are so many places that have better chicken strips for that price.,JbJDlfcnYiyZRXeHQcAVjg,I was hoping this would great but they were not! The chicken was decent but the proportions were small; especially compared to the pictures on the menu. The chicken was a little greasy but I could live with that if everything else was good. Also; their signature sauce was bland; I switched to their only other choice; honey mustard. All in all not worth the effort.  Too expensive for too little. Go to Shanes Shack instead.,JbJDlfcnYiyZRXeHQcAVjg,Raising Cane's is has taken Phoenix by Storm with its new locations.  They build from the ground up; so all their locations look the same and thus are brand new and super clean.  The food was fair; I was hoping for more of a Chik-fil-a style nugget or stripe; but instead got large strips that were pretty heavy with greasy fried coating.  The price was also high for a fast food value meal.   I would drive the extra few miles to hit up a Chik-fil-a vs. going to the Cane's that is closer to my house; but its worth a try just to check out this new chain the valley of the sun.,JbJDlfcnYiyZRXeHQcAVjg,Alright place to go if you want to try some slightly overpriced chicken strips. I ordered the standard box combo and the food was made quickly. (You definitely get your money's worth on the portion-size).  The chicken itself is nothing spectacular; I like the strips at Chick-fil-A a lot better. The sauce is unique and I'd definitely try it ; though the sample they gave me was a bit watery.,JbJDlfcnYiyZRXeHQcAVjg,I felt like a little kid eating really good chicken fingers and French fries; there aren't many options here. The staff was super friendly and the stand out item has git to be the buttery Texas toast; the fries are nothing special and the chicken was ok. One dipping sauce per order is a little cheap for the $$ your gonna spend and only one flavor? McDonald's has more options; I suggest you bring your leftover honey mustard and bbq dipping sauce with you when you visit Canes.  P.S.  the sweet tea at McDonald's is way better too; sorry guys.,JbJDlfcnYiyZRXeHQcAVjg,Raising Canes is awesome! Just got back home from swinging by after the wife was craving it and of course I'll never pass down some good chicken haha. Ended up going back a mile and some change just so we could pick up a Carniac combo w/ the best Mug Rootbeer. The atmosphere is laid back and staff have never been rude in anyway; prices are pretty good too; definitely a place worthwhile!,KECPmpLZxwroxLeUy9TDoA,"I was searching for a place that served cheese curds last night and Culvers popped up as being the \highest ranking\"" place with them. Do NOT go here for the cheese curds!! Especially if you've ever had good ones at San Tan Flats; A&W or even Buffalo Wild Wings. I don't like the breading they put on them here - they tasted more like a bad mozzarella stick than a curd. Not a fan.  I did like my burger. Fries were OK - not my favorite and I don't think I'd get them again. My husband's chicken strips were good - just pricey! I also liked how their place is set up. They have an area to order (with a HUGE) menu; and then a separate dining area. It makes it feel more like a sit down restaurant then fast food which is nice.  The custard was SO good!! I got the flavor of the day (toffee pecan) and I'd come back just for it again!!   Be sure to sign up for their e-mail and text club. I got a BOGO deal and a free scoop of ice cream off their yelp check in offer too! Made it under $18 for the 3 of us.""",KECPmpLZxwroxLeUy9TDoA,I thought this place was pretty bad - bordering on gross.  We went for the first time on a Saturday night.  It was pretty busy; a bit dirty (tables not clean; trash on floor) and the menu is pretty large and overwhelming.  When I finally got my three kids to tell me what they wanted I went up and ordered.    Wow!  For fast food that was pricey!    My husband ordered a burger and fries.  He then realized from the nutritional menu I picked up that the fries were not gluten free so he couldn't eat them.  I had a veggie burger with cheese and mushrooms.  I almost couldn't eat it.  It was the worst veggie burger I had ever had.  I also tried the cheese curd - a mix of yellow and white cheese; deep fried and they offered me packets of BBQ sauce or ranch to dip them in.  They were not good.  I don't recommend them.  The custard was the only thing that wasn't bad but I don't think I will be able to stomach going back to get it again.,KECPmpLZxwroxLeUy9TDoA,"No the place to go for a decent burger.  It was worse than \Freddy's Steakburger\"" in that it was cold; plastic and lacked a upscale burger feel.  For the price; I would go to Red Robin first.""",KECPmpLZxwroxLeUy9TDoA,"Was very excited to go to Culvers as I've been hearing about it for a few years now.  They opened up a location near me and I figured I would try it out on my way home at lunchtime.  I ordered a mushroom swiss burger with one patty; onion rings; and a strawberry shake from the drive through.  They give you a number and have you pull up to wait for your burger to be ready.  I got my bag of food and before driving off; decided to check to make sure it was right.  Alas; no onion rings just fries.  I shut my car off and walked all the way around the building to try to find the entrance as the door nearest the drive thru is for employees only.    I go in and let them know that my order was not right.  I acknowledge that the receipt does say fries but tell them that I had ordered onion rings.  The 3 people at the counter look at me like I'm crazy and then one of them goes off to tell someone else who is in the back.  This young lady comes up to me and looks at my receipt and I again acknowledge that it says fries but tell her that I'm pretty sure I said onion rings.  She looks at me and pauses and then says; \That's fine.  It will be $1.08\"".  I'm slightly annoyed at this point because I'm not sure why this is taking so long.  I tell her that I do not have my wallet and that it is in the car because I just ran out of the car to get my order fixed.  She gives me a \""Don't know what to tell you\"" look and says that it'll cost $1.08 for the onion rings because they cost more than the fries.  I'm beyond frustrated so I tell them that it's fine and I will just take these.    I get home and the burger is so-so.  The cheese was smaller than the patty and there were hardly any mushrooms on it.  The fries were bland.  The strawberry shake wasn't bad but  not as thick as I like.    So unfortunately; they lost a customer because of this frustrating customer service.  If they had a screen at the drive thru order stop OR if they even had the girl taking order REPEAT BACK the order this whole fiasco could have been avoided.    And seriously; they should have just taken back the fries and given me the onion rings.  A bad burger I could have overlooked and probably would have returned to try something else.  But annoying customer service is hard to get past.""",VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,I was so happy to see a 5 Guys in Phoenix.  I love their burgers and this place is just as good as the ones on the east coast.  The burgers are cooked fresh when you order them. the burger is juicy; the bacon is crispy  and the cheese melty. Delish.  You can choose from a wide selection of toppings at no additional cost.   I always get the small bacon cheeseburger and a drink. No fries.  All 5 guys fries are limp. I like my fries crunchy.  If they changed their fries I would up them to a 5 star rating.  For those that like a juicy burger reminescent  of what you make at home; with toppings customized to fit your appetite for the day 5 Guys is it.,VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,Pros - all you can eat peanuts; large portions  Cons - bad for people who are allergic to peanuts because the shells are everywhere; most expensive burger meal I've had in awhile at $12 (cheeseburger; cajun fries; and soft drink); slower than other burger joints; no drive through  The portion was big...I ended up throwing away most of my fries.  I prefer Fatburger over Five Guys.,VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,Cheeseburgers - great; though over-priced.  Fries - plenty of them; but they are cold; greasy and limp. Blehh...,VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,"The Good: The Bacon Cheeseburger  The Bad: The futuristic Battlestar Galactica soda machine that dispensed diet coke that had hints of cherry; dr. pepper and sprite in it. It was like an old \suicide\"" drink.....except the machine actually chooses the flavors for you and it tastes like hell.  The Ugly: $12.54 for a burger; fries (which could have fed a village) and a coke. I understand that their better ingredients would warrant a higher price and I actually didn't mind paying that price until after I was done.  Back to the fries for a minute....the fries were pretty good; not great. I do not complain often about having too much food but the size of the order of fries for one person is just plain stupid. More than half ended up in the trash.   My recommendation would be to go with another person and split a burger and fries......and drink tea or water so you do not have to deal with the T-1000 super duper drink dispenser.""",VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,"The burgers taste wonderful and the fries are great!  They give you tons of fries; enough to share.  The \Little Burger\"" is plenty too and the toppings are great for no extra charge.    The location in Phoenix is more than a little crowded and hectic at lunch hour and parking is downtown parking so if you are looking for a calm; quiet lunch this is not the place to go.  Prices are a bit on the high end side too.  The free peanuts are a really cute touch!""",VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,I want to like Five Guys Burgers; I really do.  My first experience with them wasn't really anything special. I do enjoy the fact that they make the burgers the way you want them too; but the ingredients going into the burger is nothing special.  Also; the way they stack the burger is what kills it for me. By putting the mushrooms and onions on the bottom of the double patties; it kind of melts the bottom bun; which was a big bummer for me. The meat wasn't spiced at all; but tasted fresh; which gives them some points.   As for the potatoes; I don't really care where they come from; so having a sign to tell us where they come from seems kind of pointless. We got the Cajun spiced fries; which the wife didn't enjoy; but I liked.   They tasted frozen though; which was kind of a let down.  EDIT: Just found out they always use fresh potatoes...didn't taste fresh.  Other than that; you do get plenty of food for the price; and the decor is nice. Staff was great.   I might try again; but with Smashburger and Fatburger around; I might not.,VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,"It's way over priced for what you get.  The burgers are good the frys are soggy and undercooked and they're not shoe-string like advertised.  You can go to Hamburger Works and the best burger in Phoenix.  You can get a \great big one\"" with everything including a large 1/2 pound of fresh beef for much less than 5 guys charges.  I also didn't like having to buy frys for 2 for $3.00.

Novelties like free peanuts and the new automated touch screen soda fountains; does not guarantee good food.  First the french fries.  They are not shoe string fries and shouldn't be advertised as such.  You expect a crispy fry because of the lack of thickness... these are only a smidge smaller than steak fries and with that; more soggy and less crispy.  You do get a boat load of them though.  Secondly; this is not fast food.  You sit and wait just like at a Fuddruckers.  Not having a wait staff to bring you your food does not make a fast food joint.  It's slower than IN and OUT; but faster than a Red Robin.  There seems to be a trend in them advertising things that they are not.  Maybe I'm spending to much time watching the food network; but if you are going to say something is a certain thing; it should be; yes?  I've got to agree with some of the other disappointed customers; the burgers are flat taste wise.  Having an extensive \condiment\"" list can't compensate for that.  The toppings pale in comparison to the quality you'd get on a double-double elsewhere.  I'm also pretty sure the grilled mushrooms are canned (try getting a grilled flavor out of something that is waterlogged)  Lastly 13 bucks for a bacon double; fries and a soft drink is not worth it.  Maybe being in Phoenix and having IN and OUT's for fresh burgers and Fatburger's for the expanded line of condiments (who doesn't love a fried egg on their cheese burger) just kinda spoiled me in that I can't see coming back.  Because 5 guys is kind of an expensive combination of the two; but does nothing better than them.  But hey; if free peanuts is your thing; have at it.""",VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,5 Guys is great.  Love the burgers and fries; though every time we eat there we have a lot of fries leftover.  Usually get the double Bacon cheeseburger with everything and A1 sauce; fries and a drink and always leave full and happy.  Finally tried a hot dog which was Great.  You can choose the same topping for your hamburger for your hot dog. Much better than IN&OUT and your burger fast food chains.  Yes a little pricer but willing to pay more to have my food cook to order than a reheated burger.  Very friendly and happy staff. The noisy atmosphere works for me and JR; he can be a little more vocal and not bother anyone.  Mellow Yellow is good but also good to see Coke Zero on tap too.,VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,"I kept hearing good things about the place; and they're popping up all over Phoenix; so I decided to give it a try.  I was not impressed with the place.  $11.78 for a bacon cheeseburger; regular fries; and regular drink (the smallest portion of fries and drink.  The burger was two patties; for a total of 7 ounces of beef.  Seems a little high for a fast-food quality meal.  The beef wasn't bad - cooked well done but still a little juicy.  It didn't have a lot of flavor; which puts it behind places like Fatburger or In-N-Out; and well behind places like Fuddruckers or Islands.  With so many topping options; it was a little disappointing to not have a cheese option - the American cheese they used was a little greasy.  It would have been nice to be able to choose; at least from the mainstream cheeses like cheddar and swiss; maybe even pepper jack or mozzarella.  I ordered it with lettuce; tomatoes; and grilled onions; each of which was better than the counterparts at In-N-Out; and probably on par with Fatburger.  They were reasonably fresh-tasting; but not \good burger place\"" fresh.  The fries were really not impressive - I probably should have ordered the cajun fries; maybe then they would have had some decent flavor.  The free peanuts were a nice addition; but it's strange to have a place with shelled peanuts but no place to put the shells.  The places I've been to with buckets of shelled peanuts either have something like a bucket at each table; or you just throw your shells on the floor; kind of adding to the decor - this place didn't do either - not really a big deal; but just seemed a little strange.  Overall; I'd say the place is overpriced; a little bland; and definitely overhyped.""",VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,Overpriced; over rated. The burger wasn't good; the fries were limp.  I will never go back.  In-n-out for me...,VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,Come on people! Enjoy a good burger (and good fries!).  It seems to me that this place is being held to some kind of higher standard for some reason.  This is a fine burger; with plenty of options for fresh ingredients.  It's a soft bun; wrapped up to make a kind of melty-mash of burger goodness.   The fries are great fresh cut natural potatoes. - just the way I like 'em.  I would defiantly give 5 guys a try and find out for yourself. The times I've been there the staff has been friendly and quick. The food has been spot on.  One more thing: it's NOT cheap.  It's not going to keep me away from In-N-Out; but it's a nice once-in-a-while burger.,VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,5 stars for an upscaled fast food burger joint.  My daughter enjoys this place; and when we are in the neighborhood; we will lunch here.  Prices are obviously posted; so you know going in this is not a $1.00 burger.  But you get what you pay for; and Five Guys is no exception. Expect a simple starter burger around $4.5; big old bacon cheeseburger checks in at under $8.  EVERY time; the order is accurate.  The fries are made of REAL potatoes; served  very hot; fresh; super yum. One regular order easily  covers two people.   I love how you can choose any number of add-ons and condiments and there's no extra charge- this includes extra cheese; grilled onions; grilled jalapenos; etc. And there's a huge assortment of condiments to choose from.  You can also get your burger wrapped in lettuce or as a bowl if you don't want a bun. The burger itself is made of high quality beef.  Casual environment; music playing when we've been there.  It's clean; employees are very friendly.,VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,Ok; I was a little torn on this one. I wanted to give it 4 stars but this is why it only received 3.   THREE STAR REASONS:   First; it was a little pricey. 25 dollars and some change for 1 bacon cheeseburger; 1 little bacon cheeseburger; 1 little cheeseburger; 1 regular Cajun fry and 2 regular drinks.   Second; the fries even though hand cut they weren't hot and actually could have been cooked a little more; they still were a little hard in the middle. If they would have been left in the fryer a few seconds longer they totally would have reminded me of the fries my Mother made at home.  WORTH 4 STARS:   First; the uber cool beverage dispensers.   Second; the service was fast and friendly even though they were extremely busy.   Three; the burger. It was hot; gooey; loaded with all of the fresh toppings I asked for. I loved the taste of the sesame seed bun. I can't find any fault with the burger except the $5.29 price.   Is it great food? No; it's good for fast food; but honestly for the $25 my husband; son and I could have had a nice lunch at a sit down restaurant for the same price. Would I go back. Yes if I was in the area and wanted a burger.,VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,Great burgers. Fast service. Not enough seating. So what; you get free peanuts? Cajun fries are nothing special. Absolutely no feeling of human/customer service presence. In and out is cheaper and better...,VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,I'd been waiting for this Five Guys to open ever since they put the signage up a few weeks ago; and was pumped to see the 'now open' sign when I drove by.  I was able to convince the wife to go later for dinner.  Walked in around 5:30 or so; and there was only one person in front of us in line; and the restaurant (and nice patio) was about 50% full.  We ordered quickly and got situated at our table before I went up to get drinks.  I was pleasantly surprised at the variety of drinks that were available; I counted 14 different fountain drinks (including Cherry Coke; Mello Yello; Orange Fanta and the other usual Coke stand-bys) as well as a Gold Peak dispenser with three different flavors.  I also thought it was nice that all over the restaurant there were boxes of peanuts for patrons to enjoy while waiting for their meals to come out.  My assumption was that it takes awhile to get the food.  Well; I was wrong on that one; because my food was up pretty quickly (less than five minutes).  I'd imagine if it was really busy it'd take take a touch longer; but for this visit; it was good.  I had a cheese burger (which was double pattied); the wife had a cheese veggie sandwich and we split the smallest size of fries.  Now this may have been the smallest size...but we could have probably fed four people off the amount that we got; it was a very generous portion.  Good flavor; but they weren't crisp.  I thought they could have been cooked a little more; the wife thought maybe they had sat out for a bit.  The burger; I liked; meat seemed nice a fresh; with good flavor.  The bun was fresh; but I've had better.  Off one serving; if I had to choose between In N Out or Five Guys forever; I'd probably give In N Out the nod; but this burger is definitely bigger/heartier than what you are going to get at In N Out.  I could see Five Guys growing on me with a few more visits.    I had previous heard that Five Guys was kind of expensive...I thought it was a pretty good value for our two sandwiches; fries and one soda (wife got water)...less than $15.  (Note:  I did think it odd that there was a tip bucket up front...I mean; there isn't a waiter; I had to go get my own food and I bused my own table...I wouldn't tip at McDonald's...).  Anyways; this is a solid 3.5 for me.  I could definitely see this moving up to a 4 after another visit; but I wasn't blown away this time.  I am excited they are here and a solid burger option for me.,VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,A burger with whatever-the-hell-you-want on it for no extra charges for things like jalapeno; grilled onions or peppers;etc sounds like a smokin deal.  $5 for that burger alone; with no combo deals in sight; brings you back down to earth.  The beef is high quality; with no grissly bits; and the toppings choices are many with plentiful; almost too much; volume.  Makes for a deliciously sloppy affair to eat a burger that is just as tall as it is wide!  I was worried when I unwrapped my tinfoil and saw that the bun had been pretty much smashed down during assembly.  I looked around and it was standard operating procedure; so I dug in; and the bun held up surprisingly well for being so pushed to its limits of moisture absorbtion and weight support.  Salt peanuts! Salt peanuts!  free for the taking.  They are everywhere -- something to be aware of if you have one of those allergic kids that they shut down school for when a classmate opens a PBJ sandwich too close. I also worried about their storage technique for the sacks of potatoes.  Either they are wasting hundreds of pounds of spuds; or they plan on using these after storing them out where any kid could poke their grubby little fingers into holes in the sacks; or stab the potatoes with a pen; or punch and bruise them; etc.  Prices are high; but I dig Five Guys B&F.  You seem to get what you pay for; except for the drink -- $2.19 for a 32 oz is just gouging.,VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,"So one time my friend says.. Hey .. what do they serve at five guys?

No; I am pretty sure there is not a healthy item on the menue...so this is a treat...but a welcome one. As far as the pricing goes...yep it is a bit pricey...but I can spend $6-7 on a \""value\"" meal at a fast food joint...why not get some real meat and toppings for a few bucks more...Share the fries there is more than enough to go around :)""",VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,So I am only 96.27% positive that I have been to a 5 Guys in Carson; CA (South of Los Angeles; by the Ikea) So; I've read some of the other reviews; and I totally get the VISUAL comparisons to In and Out; but that's it really.  The fries are a million times better!  The burgers were thicker and juicier and so flavorful! The bacon was great; the bbq sauce was tasty; the grilled onions were great; good texture not as grilled and mushy as In and Out. I think my sandwich would have been better with Cheddar rather than American cheese. The American was a little too salty for my taste; but it was still a great burger! I do have to say though; it is a bit pricey. I paid $12 for a bacon cheese burger; fries and a large drink. That's not much cheaper than Delux or Fez; and more expensive than Smash Burger.

Thankfully; I proclaim I AM NO TRADER. And the winner; yo 5 guys.  In n out burger was cliche; cheaper; less clean; crowed; crappy fries. I declare 5 guys burger joint is the best.,VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,I enjoyed a double cheeseburger with no bun (wrapped in lettuce) and extra mushrooms.  I still perfer In and Out for the food and price.,VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,Great neighborhood burger joint. I feel like even as a franchise; they haven't skipped any corners.  My only qualm is that I'm highly allergic to tomatoes. Even though I do not order tomatoes on my burger; it never fails that they put one on there; and I have to tell them to remake. Not sure if they are on auto pilot sometimes; but definitely something I always check for.  The soda machine used to be an attraction but I've started seeing these machines in other restaurants now.  The cajun fries are tasty but I wish they were just a little more crispy and not as soggy.  Fun place for a quick lunch or dinner; but the prices seem a little high for a *regular* spot.,VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,I have been to five guys on several occasions. Love the burgers and fresh fries. On this visit the man running the register gave us great advice on ordering fries a certain way which saved me some cash and still gave my family plenty of fries.    This isn't the cheapest burger joint in town but the food is good and fresh. It's a nice treat and a good break from the usual fast food grind.,VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,Wanted a burger for dinner and wanted to try something new. My first impression wasn't the greatest. They have bags of their french friends and boxes of oil all over the place as a display! Is this their idea of decor or did they just run out of room in the back? The music is SO LOUD you can't even think. I can barely hear the girl as I was trying to give her my order.   You mean to tell me the $6.99 cheeseburger is ONLY a cheeseburger? No fries or anything with it? Almost $12 for a cheeseburger and fries? NO DRINK. That's crazy!! I didn't realize it was that expensive until I was ordering and I didn't want to embarrass myself and walk away. I figured I'd try it.  I do have to say; the food is very good. Fries were delicious. Burger was good too but really sloppy.   Would I go again? Probably not. The price is just out of control! $12 for a burger and fries is just insane! Whataburger and In-n-Out has food that's just as delicious; right down the street; and literally HALF the price.   Good food but nothing to write home about. I just can't get over the price!,VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,Wanted a burger for dinner and wanted to try something new. My first impression wasn't the greatest.

Their burgers are all right but overpriced and greasy,VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,This is another welcome addition to Bell Town Center; which has been adding some great new businesses in the past few months. I had the little bacon burger which was perfect. Super crispy bacon. My husband had the Cheeseburger.double patties. He enjoyed it. I loved the fries..if you are a crispy skinny fry kind of person; than forget coming here. They were thick; and a bit on the soggy side; which is just how I love them. They have mello yello as a fountain drink option. Mello yello! take me back to 1986! It was pricey..burgers; 1 medium drink; 1 large fry-$18 and change.  the atmosphere was fun; and I didn't see the peanuts until we left; darn! We'll be back.,VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,I have been meaning to try this place out for a long time but I've been hesitant because of reviews stating it's over priced. While I agree that the burgers and fries cost way too much I think the burger was delicious and the fries were as well. I never get onions on a burger but since they were grilled I had to give it a try. Yum.  The fries reminded me of the fries we would have at home when I was living with my parents. We never bought frozen fries and always made our own so Five Guys were spot on. I ordered the small fries but I still couldn't finish them all. Very good though.,VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,I have been meaning to try this place out for a long time but I've been hesitant because of reviews stating it's over priced.

BUT Five guys is pretty darn good. I love that you can customize your burgers. Gooey cheese... grilled onions; mushrooms; peppers what ever pleases your taste buds.    The fries were excellent and even better than In-and-Out; especially when you add their Cajun seasoning. The prices were decent (though more expensive than In-and-Out after you include their fries and drink).  Is this the best fast food burger I've ever eaten? No; but it is pretty gosh darn good for fast food burgers. This is better than your average burger; so look out Culver's.

The food is fresh and you can choose from a variety of toppings (from mushrooms to peppers) to add on your burger. Also; their fries are pretty good; though they are not as unique as In-N-Out's or McDonald's; I recommend ordering the seasoned ones.  Be sure to tell them you want a \little\"" hamburger or cheeseburger or they will give you a double patty burger.""",VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,I have no idea what the buzz is about unless they hired a good PR agency. The burgers are as average as possible which makes the place over priced. Try Smashburger or Lucky Boy if you want a really great burger.,VsrvWdZL2993olnW3z8R3A,"Just moved to Phoenix from Southern California and while exploring the area stumbled on Five Guys.  I was excited because I have friends in Philly that tout this place.  We headed over at about 2 to let the lunch rush die down--we only had 3 people in front of us but the restaurant was about 75% full.    I ordered the cheeseburger and DH got the bacon cheese burger both \all the way\"".  We each got a small order of fries; mine regular his cajun style.  We were #68; so we got our drinks; sat down and waited (opted out of getting peanuts).  It took less the 5 minutes for our food to be up and boy am I glad we didn't get peanuts.    The burgers were double pattied with sauted shrooms; onions; pickles; lettuce; tomatoe and ketchup and mustard.  The french fries came in small cups but there were at least that many at the bottom of the bag too....no way we would eat all of those.  Next time 1 small order.  I now also understand what a \""little\"" burger is on the menu; it must be one pattie.  The burgers were good; sloppy with all that stuff; but really good flavor.  Glad they were wrapped in foil so I had something to hold it all together with.  The fries were done in peanut oil (I assume).  Not cripsy but I don't think they were supposed to be.  They were good; but the cajun was a bit much.    The price was reasonable just $20 for two big burgers; 2 fries and 2 drinks.  Will definitely go again.""",A7Soqlerr3L8mNq3YuIqAA,After hearing a bit about Five Guys online; I decided to give them a try.  First impression walking in was very positive.  I liked the decor and the free self-serve peanuts.     Unfortunately; that did not last.  My jaw literally hit the floor when I saw the prices.  Over $5 for a hamburger from a counter-service (i.e. fast-food) restaurant?  Worse yet; I had my three kids with me and Little Cheeseburgers are over $4 each.  I have to say we almost walked out; but I still wanted to try it.   So we proceeded with ordering.   I got the hamburger with french fries.  The hamburger was very good.  No doubt about that.  The french fries were okay; but nothing special.  If the burger would have been $3 - $4; I'd probably say it was one of the best I've had in that price range.  At over $5 though; there are many just as good if not better options.  Bottom line: good food; but way overpriced.,A7Soqlerr3L8mNq3YuIqAA,"Man; I guess I just don't get it. I've tried this place twice now; and was unimpressed both times. I really don't understand the excitement over this place.  Just another example of how Eastern transplants to the Phoenix area clamor for anything from \BACK HOME.\"" Plus; this place is way too expensive for an \""Order at the Counter\"" burger joint.  Went in last time with a buddy: 2 REG burgers; 1 REG order of fries to split; NO DRINKS - $17.02 WOW! Not to mention (but I will); that it took over 15 minutes to get my order; when this place was nearly empty!!!  The burger was bland and overcooked. The bacon was burnt and crumbled; not even in strips; but looked like somebody just put some charred bac-o-bits on it. High marks for the freshness of the toppings; but so what. After all; it's not called \""5 Guys Toppings;\"" is it.  And the fries couldn't be worse if you were actually trying to make them BAD. Just a bland; greasy mess. Yuck.  Maybe; if somebody offers to buy me lunch and insists on 5 Guys; I'll give them another shot. Otherwise; NO WAY!""",A7Soqlerr3L8mNq3YuIqAA,Over priced; waited to long; alittle dirty. Honestly I rather go to in and out to get better service for a better price,A7Soqlerr3L8mNq3YuIqAA,Food was delicious but overpriced. Service was friendly. Their very limited menu did not offer shakes and malts which was disappointing.  Their dinning environment was uncomfortable for such high prices.,A7Soqlerr3L8mNq3YuIqAA,I normally don't write reviews for chain food places; I don't really see the point. They wouldn't be a chain if it didn't appeal to a large number of people.  This place is basically Johnny Rockets without the milk shakes; but with tons of toppings available for free. Value; in terms of pricing; is excellent. The menu is simple and it shouldn't take too long to figure out what you want if its your first time.  While you wait on your order you can work your way to the shelled peanuts which are self-serve and free. This is pretty cool I thought; and unlike Teakwoods; there aren't shells on the floor everywhere.  The toppings. Wow; tons of choices. I went with grilled mushrooms; grilled onions; onions; tomatoes; lettuce; pickles and jalapenos. The tomatoes and jalapenos were sliced too thick in my opinion; way too thick. However; the jalapenos were fresh; and not pickled. They were a little too spicy for me; but it was good. The lettuce wasn't so green; and to be quite honest I don't really remember seeing too much lettuce. Due to the sheer size of the toppings; it becomes a pain in stacking the burger and eating it.  BEEF! I'm a little mixed on how to rate the burger patties. I felt that they were a tad bit too dry for my taste; but that the texture was very interesting; unique; and enjoyable. I hate to bring up Lobby's into this review; but if there is one thing Lobby's does well its their patties. I'm stuck in an awkward situation here. I liked their patties; but I've had better. I'll leave it at that.  Cajun fries. The cajun fries were awesome. Its exactly what it sounds like; fries seasoned with cajun seasoning. Delicious. I ordered a regular; and I must have got two supersized fries instead of one regular. I think it must have been a mistake; because the large brown bag that your order comes in (whether you do dine-in or take-out) was FULL of fries. I tried to finish them all with my 9 year old brother and we couldn't do it; there was just too much. To make the situation worse; we brought home a cup full of fries. This isn't a bad thing; just don't order too much fries or you'll have a ton leftover.  This place is over decorated. Its annoying. Every inch of space is filled with non-local reviews for this place. Are you kidding me? Can you let me decide by myself whether your food is good or not? Of course; this is America and if something is a fashion you have to adhere to the fashion if you wanna be American. But anyways; besides the loads of what amounts to self-praise; the rest of the wall is covered in red and white checkers. Also; there ar not booths; just tables and chairs; which can get a little cramped at times.  Five Guys is a really good burger place; especially if you want a 'diner style' burger for a drive-thru price. You may or may not like the interior; but its a cool place to check out.,A7Soqlerr3L8mNq3YuIqAA,"Five Guys is so good. Have to admit that the first time I tried them I was not to impressed but on subsequent visits I have grown to really like them. It seems there is a big Five Guys Vs In N Out thing going on but I don't thing you can compare them. they each have there own unique taste. Plus I don't want to choose on over the other. They are both great. Now Five Guys is just a little more expensive but just a little and it is so worth it. Also just a tip unless you really love french fries just order the small because they pile more than enough into the bag. Which is great but why pay for a large when you get enough with a small unless of course you want a ton of fries. I know they have hot dogs and grilled cheese sandwiches but I haven't been able to get by the burgers yet. They are so good. I get it \all the way\"" except leave off the grilled mushrooms unless I am in the mood for them. Also a warning their regular burgers are doubles so unless you like double burgers make sure you let them know you want a single. But the menu is fairly simple and you can get anything made the way you want it. Also if you want to hang out and eat there they have free peanuts. The staff is always really nice. You can see them make your food and the place is always clean. Just wish it was a little cheeper so I could eat there more often. They also get an extra point because they have a Coke Freestyle machine.""",A7Soqlerr3L8mNq3YuIqAA,I know its a burger place but try the hotdogs.  All items are grilled.    Buns are fresh.  Tons of items to add to your burger/hotdog that are free.  FREE.  No charge.  Fries are awesome.  A sign tells you where the potatoes are from that day.  And they are not cheap with them.  One small is enough for two; sometimes three.  Fast and friendly service.  Somewhat loud; rock music playing; which makes the burger joint experience complete.,A7Soqlerr3L8mNq3YuIqAA,Such a good burger!! So juicy and delicious!! Lots of choices and they are all... FREE (except for a select few)!! Their fries are OK. I prefer in-n-outs better; but I'll live. My biggest complaint is the price. It takes longer than any fast food joint to get your burger and it's double the price. Yes; they are delicious; but it's still just a burger. I do really like the fact that they have peanuts to snack on while you're waiting! That does help.,A7Soqlerr3L8mNq3YuIqAA,Really good food but too greasy for my liking! Expensive for the type of food they serve. Very friendly staff.,A7Soqlerr3L8mNq3YuIqAA,5 Guys is a notch better than In & Out.  The only thing that worries me is the price of Five Guys.  Thats going to turn a lot of people off.  They need to keep it under $10 for one person ordering a burger; fries and drink.  Great place though.,A7Soqlerr3L8mNq3YuIqAA,Crappy Excuse for a Burger....  1) Tin Foil  2) Tin Foil with hamburger inside 3) Tin Foil with hamburger inside full of grease     equals soggy slimy lettuce and tomatoes; cheap cheese; soaked grease bun = a real shitty experience; specially when it costs 13 Dollars for fries and drink.    it takes 5 Guys to make a shitty hamburger?

You get a very tasty and high quality burger with the toppings you like.   You also get a ton of fries; even on the small order.

Ok so I've never been to the East Coast and I'm an Arizona Native so the only comparison for this burger joint is other burger joints in the valley.   The burger is actually a double; you order the toppings individually; and they have the standards. They make it in front of you which is nice. The pattys were tasty and the buns were some of the best on a burger i've ever had!! Fries were good as well.  We ordered two burgers; one side of fries and one drink and the total was $18.xx. Expensive? Well it's more expensive than McDonalds of course but not more than a restaurant; it's a good middle ground. I think you pay for the quality. I definitely don't mind paying extra for a great tasting quality burger!   The decore was......um....interesting. Pretty white everywhere. Peanuts as an appetizer?!? And on the wall was non-local reviews. I rather have local reviews but that's all minor. I went to get a good tasting non-fast food chain burger and that's what I got. I'm happy; and will be returning; probably several times.   FYI-If they had alcohol; they would have gotten 5 stars from me.

The only thing they don't have that we miss is chocolate shakes. I would love to dunk the fries here into a chocolate shake.   They offer a \veggie burger\"" that is basically all of their condiments on a bun. You can add cheese if you like as well. I think its pretty good and its a nice break from the basic veggie patties you see at most places. They have the best fries here. We like the cajun style the best; and the regular size is plenty for two people. They basically fill up one cup full of fries and put it in the bag; and then dump another full cup in the bag. So you are getting two cups of fries. We never finish them. They are made to order so they are always piping hot. Friendly staff and you can munch on some peanuts before your food comes out.   For two veggie burgers; fries; and two drinks we can get out of here at less than $15. Regular burgers and hot dogs end up costing more so if you are an omnivore it could get a little pricy. But for us vegetarians its a darn good deal.""",A7Soqlerr3L8mNq3YuIqAA,Better burger & fries than In-N-Out; but a little pricey for a burger joint with loud music and no adult beverages or dessert.  I say better than In-N-Out because it's a similar concept of freshly cut fries and grill top burgers with fresh toppings.  Where they excel is the burger patties are bigger and the fries have more flavor.,A7Soqlerr3L8mNq3YuIqAA,Man; this stuff is good.  Yes they are a bit pricey; but you are getting really good quality and really good burgers. You'd pay more for a crappy burger at Applebee's; for sure. Five Guys doesn't really compare to fast food if you know your beef.  As an aside; the soda machines are a fascinating study in generational usability. Just sit over there and observe for five minutes.,A7Soqlerr3L8mNq3YuIqAA,I don't think I've ever complained about price in a review; but $12.54 for a fast food cheeseburger; fries; and a medium drink?  The burger was ok and the fries were pretty good. Probably won't be back. Too many better choices out there (Lobby's; Zipps; Macs; 4Peaks; and of course the greatest of all The Chuck Box).,A7Soqlerr3L8mNq3YuIqAA,Soggy overpriced fast food burger with allot of hype. When you have to cover the walls with quotes how good your product is; then you have to something to hide.,A7Soqlerr3L8mNq3YuIqAA,"Maybe it's because I am from the east coast; but I don't see the love for In-N-Out burgers.  Since everyone is comparing them here is my 2 cents. Five Guys Burgers are hand formed and taste way more like beef than the thin tiny burgers at In-N-Out.  You can also get pretty much any topping you can think of at Five Guys.  The real stand out is the fries.  I recommend getting them with Cajun as that makes them truly amazing.  No matter what size fires you get they give you a ton of them.  More than enough to share. For what you get I don't see how Five Guys is really that more expensive than any of the other burger places around here.  A \regular\"" burger here is a double patty burger and very large.  I usually get a small burger and that's just fine.""",A7Soqlerr3L8mNq3YuIqAA,great burger- one of the best i have had; but a little pricey for a fast foodish kind of place.. love the cool soda machine too !,A7Soqlerr3L8mNq3YuIqAA,The first time I went to 5 guys I hated it but I'm a true believer of 2nd chances.  I ordered the double bacon cheeseburger and wasn't disappointed. I mean; nothing memorable; but a pretty decent taste for a decent price.  The service was really good and the best is the Coke machine that has tons of flavors. Got to love it!,A7Soqlerr3L8mNq3YuIqAA,We ate here on our last day in Phoenix;  ;there tends to be a queue;but it does go down quite quick.

I love being able to order online and then go pick it up.,jqZKv-7F54guDLalXEjHxg,Went there yesterday to give Five Guys another chance and had a cheeseburger (one patty); fries and a soft drink for $9.42. I couldn't even taste the burger since the enourmous bun swallowed the burger. Obviously; this bun is meant for the double patty burgers. The regular fries are ok but the cajun fries are brutal because they are drenched with spices which renders the fries inedible. I can think of few burger joints off the top of my head that have a much lower price point and burgers that are much more tastier than Five Guys (Culver's; Lenny's & In-n-Out to name a few).,jqZKv-7F54guDLalXEjHxg,"There is nothing I love more than a good burger; plain and simple; the way God and America intended it to be; and Five Guys delivers. With the new; trendy \gourmet\"" burger trend sweeping through Scottsdale; a plain old burger was just what the doctor ordered to get me out of my \""goat cheese and grilled pineapple with arugula\"" burger rut. Went today with a pal during lunch time and holy moley; it was CROWDED! You wonder where everyone in Arizona is in the summer? At Five Guys; sheesh! My pal insisted I order the \""little burger\""... and even though I told her I was ravenous; she said; \""no; you want the LITTLE burger\"". Expecting a slider sized burger; I was surprised to see it was completely normal sized; maybe even a bit bigged than an In and Out. I was also pleasently surprised because they say their burgers are \""well-done and juicy\"". I myself; like my burgers still moo-ing. Well; I could barely tell they were well done; and Holy Mary; it was the juiciest burger I had ever had! The fries were hot; fresh; and still had the potato skin on; amazing. It is a little on the pricey side. I should have ordered the small fries; but like I said; I was starving; and ordered the big ones. My friend had a hot dog and it looked pretty good. My fave thing: endless topping INCLUDED! Wahooooo! It is definetly a great place to check out; maybe next time I will just get take out; cause it was a bit crowded. I did love the old fashioned feel; with the potato sacks everywhere and the open kitchen with fry cooks chettering away in their crazy kitchen jargon. Being from Chicago; a lot of places have open kitchens and to me; it is a fun thing to watch the interection and the burger flipping. Great place; go; and you will be happy to have a good; plain; old fashioned BURGER!!! NO GOAT CHEESE; YAY!!!""",jqZKv-7F54guDLalXEjHxg,This place is pretty yummy; we were pretty stuffed after eating here. I think I still like in n out a little better since I can get a double double; fries and shake for the cost of the smallest burger at five guys; but they definitely are better with all the free toppings. I had the little bacon cheeseburger with lettuce; tomatoes; grilled mushrooms; and grill onions. Bf had the regular cheeseburger (2 meat patties) with everything and green bell peppers. I'm not really sure why they flatten the meat when they grill it; maybe to cook it faster or fit the humongous bun?  We shared cajun style fries which were tasty--i think it's just seasoned salt on top. The soda machine is pretty awesome; never had to use a touch screen to get a drink before. Fancy stuff. I liked the free peanuts while we waited :),jqZKv-7F54guDLalXEjHxg,"I would say this is a 3;5 star burger place.    The burger is solid with nice flavors and fresh lettuce; onion and tomato.  I had mayo; mustard and ketchup on my burger.    Ive read a lot about the discussions about the eastcoasts Five Guys vs In n out on the west coast and for me theres really not that much of a fight.   Yes \Five Guys\"" is a good burger (among many others) but there are some crucial things that seperates the two.    *If Five Guys is a 3;5 in taste; In n out are always a 5!; *Appearence. Five Guys looks kind of sad as a burger especially compared to In n out's picture perfect burger goodness.  *Price. I paid 10 $ for a burger with fries and soda at FG.  A double double with fries and soda at In n out will set you back about 6;50 $!    Conclusion: Five Guys is a nice burgerplace when the cravings set in and you dont have the In n out joint close by.""",jqZKv-7F54guDLalXEjHxg,Great burger! Love the fact that you have so many  add on options for your 1 or 2 patty burger. The fries are good too... You can actually taste the potato; not just oil and salt. Overall with fries and a drink the cost for lunch is $10.00+ so it's not the cheapest place to grab lunch but I would have to say it's worth it.   I've been to this site a few times and have had great service everytime.,jqZKv-7F54guDLalXEjHxg,Great burger! Love the fact that you have so many  add on options for your 1 or 2 patty burger.

All the food is al a carte; so you do not get your burger with fry's; they are extra. I paid roughly $11 for a cheeseburger; fries; and drink. My friend paid roughly $8 for his cheeseburger and drink. The fries can easily be shared between two people as it was way more than I could eat; in fact two of us actually ended up throwing away half the fries; there were so many. They have a fairly decent choice of toppings; the typical lettuce; onion; tomato; and options for grilled onions; jalapenos; and a couple others at no extra charge. The price may be a bit high for a fast-food joint; but rest assured you'll be getting your fill.,jqZKv-7F54guDLalXEjHxg,Just an ok burger. I know I'm not the only one that thinks this place is WAY over priced. People must love to be parted with their money. A burger; small fries and soda with tax is over $11 friggin dollars here. I'd rather get 2 double doubles from In n Out for $7; and be WAY more satisfied. Five Guys burger is messy and falla sapart easy and the fries are not so great.  I'll be at In n Out any day over this place; save your money folks.,jqZKv-7F54guDLalXEjHxg,"Ummm okay so this is the most amazing; yummy; place for burgers. If you have never eaten a burger here you will bite into your perfectly made meal; put it down; and tell your friend through garbled words that it's the best burger you've ever had.   Everything is fresh and they offer a ton of toppings. You can get regular fries or cajun flavored. I find Cajun flavored a must since you can't get it anywhere else and the regular frieds are kind of plain; although they are seasoned with salt.   Only problem is this food is really; really high in calories (duh) but it's worth it. Just don't eat and feel guilty about it. Enjoy it.  If you don't want a burger they do have hot dogs and grilled cheese. Both look good. Also; the way the soda machine words is cool and the soda tastes really delicious.   Service is great. I've walked in at 9:50 starving and apologizing for coming in so late and the staff reassured me I was fine. That says something -- although what exactly I couldn't tell you.  There menu is basic and they don't have milkshakes.

Yeah; there are worse places to go; but Wendy's would have been as good (maybe better)  for less money and a drive through. If you eat in; you still get your food in a bag and not on a tray; which seems wasteful to me. They serve raw peanuts in here which is nice; but who goes to a burger joint for peanuts?

Arrived to an unorganized place with staff not very engaged in what they were doing after waiting for eye contact at the pickup counter; it was learned that my order was lost and so I got to wait 20 minutes for my order.  Staff unapologetic and really just slinging overpriced burgers. Got 3 burgers and 3 fries was about $35.  Burgers were okay not great kind of thin; in and Out and Carls Jr better for sure.  I will not be back.,jqZKv-7F54guDLalXEjHxg,Being that I work across the street I felt like I had to come check it out; even though I've had bad experiences at other 5 guy locations. I actually was entertained by the energy the people working had. They were all dancing around to music while making food and looked like they we're having a good time. I decided to order the veggie sandwich ; since I broke and that's the cheapest/healthier choice on the menu. It was really good!!!! Like a boss cheese sandwich it came with saut_ed onions; mushrooms; tomatoes; lettuce and American cheese.  The only reason I give this place 4/5 was because their tomatoes weren't ripe.  Definitely coming back for that sandwich though; even with a jimmy johns next door. Lol,jqZKv-7F54guDLalXEjHxg,"This place is sooo conveniently close to my office... it's hard not to go to often. But; as other reviewers have stated its a little pricey for a \fast food\"" style burger joint. Granted that this is NO McDonalds!! But... In and Out is not far away either... and they are pretty damn good too! This is a place I come 2 -3 times a month... more than that and you will need to see your doctor and have them check the cholesterol!   I love the burgers here. They are huge; delicious; and fresh. Be careful ordering the larger order of fires... as they are huge! And you can get them with Cajun seasoning.    One thing I absolutely love... as I am a gadget guy; and \""buttons\"" make me happy... is the soft drink dispenser!!! It is uber-cool.... and hard not to play with!""",jqZKv-7F54guDLalXEjHxg,After having an awful experience (filthy restaurant with only two employees) at the Five Guys on Camelback and with the Five Guys corporate office I thought I would give this location a try and I'm glad I did. I went in for fries and wound up getting a hotdog and a soda. Lets see: Hotdog at a hamburger place...... It was good Fries........ Fabulous! Fresh; crispy and tasty Soda....... I love their 100 flavor soda machine.  All for $10. Not the cheapest lunch but I can't get enough of their fries.,jqZKv-7F54guDLalXEjHxg,"Let's start with the positive: Cajun fries were pretty flavorful and fresh; neat red and white decor and I like the fact that true to the name \Five guys\""; there were exactly 5 guys cooking the burgers lol.  The choice of toppings were pretty good; much more than In & Out. You could choose grilled mushroom; grilled green pepper; onion; relish; A1 sauce; BBQ sauce; lettuce and other toppings you can think of.  The negative:  The patty did not melt in your mouth when i took a bite into it. The patty actually crumbled pretty fast; and was plain tasting. The bun was not that special either. For the relatively higher price for it's fast food burger; I was quite disappointed in it. I still think Shake Shack in New York and In & Out tastes alot better.""",jqZKv-7F54guDLalXEjHxg,Ok.....Here it is from the girl who is VERY picky and can usually find problems with quality or price of food....  Went to Five Guys for the first time....  I am proud to say I could not find ANYTHING that could have been improved on!  I got what they call a small cheeseburger....it was 1/4 pd juicy and yummy tasting burger and quite ample!  You get to pick any of the toppings you want....impressive.....  They used the perfect amount of condiments giving the burger an evenly tasty bite every time.  The fries were awesome....we also tried cacun fries which added a nice bite.  I felt the price was reasonable and definately worth it!  For me to find this burger near perfect is rare....very rare.... I HIGHLY reccomend you check Five Guys out!,jqZKv-7F54guDLalXEjHxg,"I needed a salad; but I saw that the Five Guys in my neighborhood had opened so I got a whole lot of greasy goodness.  I'm a fan.  They give you an unlimited amount of shell peanuts for free to snack on while you're waiting for your food.  Nice touch.  The regular burger is actually 2 patties that are 1/3 pound each.  So if you get the regular burger you're eating well over a half pound of meat.  I would rather be a wimp and order their \Little Burger\"" which is still a huge bun and a nice 1/3 pound pattie.  The burger and fries come served in a paper bag (grease stains are free).  The burger comes in foil wrap and the fries come in a paper cup.  After they put the burger and fries in the bag; they create what they call \""a topper\"" by placing a whole order; or so; of more fries on top of everything else. So when you order a small fries; you're really getting one huge order due to the topper.  The fun part is that because of all those extra fries you can't even get your burger out of the bag!  I noticed one customer ripped his bag down the side.  I managed to scoot the topper fries to one side and I somehow managed to squeeze the burger out of the bag.  Too much food.  I couldn't even finish it all.  At first I thought it was pricey; but when I got the food I realized it's a good deal.  Another nice touch is that the burger toppings are all free with no extra charge for grilled onions or grilled mushrooms.  NICE.  Finally; (and this part I love) they have ample amounts of malt vinegar for the fries.  I ADORE vinegar on my fries and these are the kind of fries that say \""pour malt vinegar on me and dip me in ketchup\"".  Welcome to town FIVE GUYS.""",jqZKv-7F54guDLalXEjHxg,We wanted a burger today so we decided to try Five Guys. My daughter recommended this place so here we are. The service was friendly and prompt. I ordered the cheese burger which is really a double cheese burger. If you I want the single then order the lite. I like the concept of ordering your toppings. They have a nice selections of topping including grilled mushrooms and Jalapeos. Burger were very juicy and tasty. The fries are good and fresh. They put your fries in a cup and then add extra by just dumping them in your bag.  We sat outside cause it was a really nice day. I was impressed cause the place was very clean inside; outside; and the bathroom. They even had people wiping down the tables outside. Expensive burger for $6.59 each but worth it every once in awhile.,jqZKv-7F54guDLalXEjHxg,"Meaty; beaty; big and bouncy!  Add \beefy\"" and you've pretty much summed up your 5GB&F  experience!  After detoxing this morning; I was really hungry...after all; I'm a pretty big and bouncy boy and when you lug this kind of tonnage up and down the canal; you're going to need some retoxing!  And since it's Taco Tuesday; I thought a burger fest sounded about right!  I needed to be up north anyway; so I texted my order (what a time and vexation saver that is!...two stars for 5GB&F right there) and it was ready; hot and juicy when I rolled in.  The burgers and fries remind me of nothing so much as Wendy's of about 30 years ago...you know; when Wendy's was actually pretty good (not like now when; they consistently screw up your order and figuratively; literally throw your bag-o-food into your car as you idle by the pickup window).  The burgers are OK; the fries are fresh and peanutty (no; really...fresh peanut oil...the fries taste peanutty!); and the Coke is; well; Cokey.   The atmosphere is nice enough; all red and white checked and tons of \""look at me\"" crap on the walls (\""Best Fries in Hoboken!\"")  The music was also reasonably pleasant (Men at Work...\""I come from a land down under\""...I shuddered a little bit at the part \""and men chunder\""...please; no chundering while I'm eating!).  Anyway...  I was able to purchase this little repast for a mere $11.83 (I saved a little by having the small fries).  I know; Grind or Delux prices for a retro Wendy's burger!  I'm no spendthrift; but I could feed a family of 6 at In-n-Out for $12...and with better burgers.  But; 5GB&F filled me up; they had my burger ready to roll and they very nicely didn't mess up my order (but then again; how could they screw it up...they were ordered to prepare my burger by a computer...we know what happens when you don't do what a computer tells you...you \""accidentally\"" ride over a cliff on your Segway; that's what happens!)   And; in a nostalgic sort of way; they reminded me of how Wendy's used to be (complete with 70's music); and for that; a reasonable 3.25 stars.""",jqZKv-7F54guDLalXEjHxg,On occasion; only a big; fat; messy greasefest will do.  An evil greasefest of deliciousness.  I like a greasy burger.  Five Guys pretty much redefined the experience for me.  Ordered what I thought would be a good cheeseburger; and got this 2-patty behemoth with 2 slices of american cheese so greasy the top of the bun was shiny.  Add grilled onions and fries cooked in peanut oil; and my heart started waving a tiny white flag even whily my taste buds were doing their happy dance.  As I was fighting to keep my eyes open on the way home I think I heard my son say he just grew a new chin.  At about $10 a person; I only wish it weren't so expensive.  It is just a burger joint; after all.  But they gotta pay for the new building with Scottsdale Rd. frontage rent and seven (seven! like clowns in a car back there!) staff behind the counter somehow.  And it really is a killer burger.  Time for nap.,jqZKv-7F54guDLalXEjHxg,My parents told me about Five Guys back East a few years ago. So; when they came here to the Valley; well...  we had to try it.   First off; the peanuts are a great idea.   The staggered circular line is a great idea. It's these little things that you first notice as you come through the door.   BTW; we also like the food!    The idea of a Little Hamburger (one patty) and a large Hamburger (two patties) works very well.  What doesn't work as well is the pricing of the Pop and French Fries...   I've read other reviews of different restaurants over the years and I have always felt the discussion of pricing to be a little..  well; petty.    Okay; so now I've broken one of my rules; but... don't get me wrong; the fries are delicious ; but $5.00? Come on.  I know in the restaurant industry they make their money;  their profit margins on the soda and side items they sell; but do you need to be so obvious about it?    So in summary; I would say great food at a premium price which works most of the time.  Will we come back; yes.  Will we order fries; well sometimes.  Here is the real question...      are they better than In-N-Out?    Umm; maybe.  Enjoy!,jqZKv-7F54guDLalXEjHxg,I was driving up Scottsdale Rd. on the way to my one guilty pleasure that I have In-and-Out; to have my once a month double double.  I looked up and saw the 5 guys sign; made a quick turn; and decided to go there instead after hearing how great this place was from my East Coast friends. I Had the regular burger (two patty's) and my wife had the small burger (1 patty) we split a large order of Cajun fries (huge portion) and each had a soda.  Set us back about $20.  Loved the variety of toppings we could put our burgers; loved the free peanuts; loved the variety of diet drinks from the soda machine (ordering a diet drink at place like this is a little twisted when you think about it) although they had run out of a couple of the varieties.  Did not like or dislike the Cajun fries after a few I had had enough. Only thing I did not like is the price.  If I had gone to In-and-Out I would have had a meal I would have enjoyed just as much but would have ended up with about $8 more in my pocket which is why Five Guys will not replace In-Ad-Out as my once a month guilty pleasure.,jqZKv-7F54guDLalXEjHxg,First time going to a Five Guys was yesterday.  I'm a fan.  When you're craving good old fashioned greasy burger and want to break your diet...this is the place to go.  According to their nutritional information...a cheesburger will provide you with ~133% of your recommended daily intake of saturated fat.  Can anyone say.....YUM?!  It's definitely a fast-food type place...but its rather pricey for fast food.  A burger/fries/drink will be about ~$10.  It's worth it though.  I had the cheeseburger; which is a double patty; with everything on it except mushrooms and pickles.  While I'm a huge In-N-Out fan...these burgers are a level up from In-N-Out in my opinion.  Maybe cuz they are so unhealthy; it just adds to the deliciousness factor.  Probably from all the peanut oil they use to cook everything in.  The fries are pretty good too...really fresh.,M6SQ1dITqcuj-sAvg8_ITg,I would definitely give them a try. I got the large shrimp po'boy and I was stuffed. The fries were hot and fresh and the sandwich was tasty. I tried my aunt's rice and beans and they were really good unlike what I expected from the other reviews I read. The people were very nice and the lunch prices were good. Dinner is more money but maybe they increase the portion size. I'm not sure. Also they give a 20% military discount on the whole order and my aunt has a military I.d. So that worked out. I'd go again for sure.,M6SQ1dITqcuj-sAvg8_ITg,this place is bomb diggity; it is a family favorite and a quick delicious dinner night option; the staff is always friendly; and more than half the time our order comes with little extras in the bag; don't be scared by prices as each order comes a la mode; we feel their chicken rivals only Lo-Lo's in town; beware as the locals will tell you; it is more of a call it in place; but be sure to try some lemon cake!,M6SQ1dITqcuj-sAvg8_ITg,The two best things at this chicken joint did not include the chicken. The sweet corn nuggets; basically a tiny corn fritter; and the cup of red hot sauce were the show stoppers. I really only like breasts and somehow this dude screwed up my phone order. I just wanted two breasts; but ended up with one breast; a wing; thigh and drumstick. Regardless; the piece I ate was semi-crunchy; but didn't really make any memories for me. If you dipped the chicken in that hot sauce though; it made things much tastier. The roll was a roll and the dirty rice was pretty average with some nuggets of ground beef or sausage running through the rice. The whole meal was only $8; so its a good price; but not a top 10 fried chicken in my book.,jvvh4Q00Hq2XyIcfmAAT2A,As good as I always remember it to be. Their fries are way better than In-n-Out (I am a fries connoisseur)  Their burgers may be getting smaller? Still delicious as ever.  I pass on the drink though; an extra $2+ makes the meal quite expensive..  Price: $9+ for the cheeseburger (double) and Regular fries (in-n-out: $6+ for double-double and fries - half the size)  I would eat here every day if I had the option.,jvvh4Q00Hq2XyIcfmAAT2A,As good as I always remember it to be.

Well; I happened to be at the bookstore in the Waterfront right next door to Fashion Square Mall; and I was a little hungry; so I figured it was a good a time as any to try it.   I'll agree that this may be the best fast food burger. (at least much better than In-N-Out). It's massive; and tasty. There's also a good selection of toppings to put on it.  The fries are decent. I thought they were a little too salty; and I would've preferred a smaller size. They only have two sizes and the smaller one is probably enough to feed four or five people (or one really fat person; who am I to judge at a burger joint?). I definitely only made it a small portion of the way through. It was more than enough food for any one person.   So why only three stars when most people would give Five Guys four or five? One big sticking point is the price. I paid more than $11 for a burger; fries and a drink. Although the place is high quality; it's still fast food; and it's not what I expect to pay for a fast food burger.  I don't mind paying for good food; but I didn't leave thinking it was worth that price.  The other is that I have to go into the mall's food court to eat here. That pretty much means the only way I'm going back is if I happen to be in the mall again. There's too many great restaurants in the area that I would much rather eat at before going back to Five Guys.,jvvh4Q00Hq2XyIcfmAAT2A,I love love love love this place! Open one in SF pretty please and show how in and out how a burger should be! Yes it's more expensive but hey double the meat with all the condiments you can possibly get equals a  fantastic burger that will feed any hungry drunk person in the city!!!,jvvh4Q00Hq2XyIcfmAAT2A,Good burger joint with fresh food and great fries - Inexpensive and has some good options for toppings (fresh Jalapenos! and I love vinegar and seasoned salt on my fries. Its a bit loud but totally worth the classic burger. Hot dogs are great as well. The real drawback is you'll gain a few pounds quickly if you eat here often but In and Out doesnt even compare..,jvvh4Q00Hq2XyIcfmAAT2A,Great burgers; excellent service and a shovelful of fries...all at a great price.   What's not to love?,jvvh4Q00Hq2XyIcfmAAT2A,Woah.    What just happened? I've never heard of this place other then seeing it next to the Jimmy John's sub shop in Tempe and thought it was a local chain. I went to the movies at the mall this past Saturday (X-men: First Class; was amazing btw!) and saw Five Guys Burgers in the food court.   I really felt like a burger and everything in that food court is kinda gross so I decided to give it a shot.   Back to my Woah.....how did I never hear of this place? For a quick cheap burger fix...this is the place. I hear all the comparison to in and out but honestly I dont see it....this place is better. Dont get me wrong; In and out has good burgers that hit the spot...but this place has amazing burgers that have customizable options AND fries to boot....and please dont say you like the fries at in and out....because they are plain bad.   These fries are large cut and freshly made that get just the right amount of seasoning on them. Delicious!!!   I've also read a couple reviews that mention price and I do have to agree....I'm taking 1 star away for value. I ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger and fries with NO drink and my total was like 11$...that is a little much for a quick fix burger joint. I dont know if prices are like this at the mall location only because rent is probably higher but I'll check out the Tempe location soon enough and find out.   All in all im very pleasantly surprised that there is a decent quick fix burger option out there other then in and out and smash burger.,jvvh4Q00Hq2XyIcfmAAT2A,Woah.    What just happened?

It's like any other Five Guys in that the burgers (in my opinion) are good but DEFINITELY overpriced. I mean you can get a burger at In-n-Out (tastes just as good) for half the price. The Coke Freestyle machine is bomb though; gotta have my Coca-Cola Orange and Peach Fanta (not mixed haha). I would give the place a 4-star rating except for one thing--WHERE ARE THE PEANUTS?! Definitely not the same vibe as the one on Mill Ave. Disappointed; but will probably eat there again in the future.,jvvh4Q00Hq2XyIcfmAAT2A,"Things I know about Five Guys:  1. They displaced In & Out on Zagats; 2. According to my husband; one order of fries can feed three people; 3. According to a good friend (who shall remain anonymous) \Yeah; it's good; but I can eat at In & Out for half the price.\""  I agree with all three.   I went to the food court for lunch after a fine time at Nordstrom with the express desire to have a chicken caesar at Ranch One Chicken; but they were gone (I don't get to this mall very often). So; after looking around I decided to try Five Guys to see what all the hype was about. When I left; I felt robbed.  Yeah; the food was fine. Not brilliant by burger standards; but fine. I threw away about half the fries because; generous though the serving was; I was by myself and didn't need to feed three people. They also had an incredibly cool soda machine with loads of flavors but it was on the seltzery side. And throughout the afternoon I couldn't shake my frustration over the amount of money I'd spent.  If I want to spend that kind of money; I'll go to Fez.""",jvvh4Q00Hq2XyIcfmAAT2A,"I went to Five Guys for the first time (North Scottsdale) to see what all the hubbub was and why everyone was comparing it to In 'N Out burger - a place I love and have been eating at for over 25 years (CA and AZ).    Pros: wider assortment of toppings and menu items; including the veggie sandwich (not a soy pattie - just veggies and cheese; if you want; extra menu items like jalapeos and hot sauce; grilled mushrooms; etc.; Cajun styled french fries (their small size is enormous).  Cons:  more expensive than In 'N Out.   Neutral: Thick burgers are more like your home grilled burgers; all well done and crispy on the edges - not like In \N Out's thinner patties.  I don't know why people compare the two places since the prices are not similar.  Five Guys is good; but should be compared more to places like Fat Burger; regarding size and price of burger.

Zagat is practially in bed with 'em and practically every town/city newspaper thinks they're the next best thing; according to their decor.  What I mean is that their place is literally plastered with praises given to Five Guys by different publications.  As I stood waiting for my food; I really came to hate their decor.  I can understand \Best of Phoenix\"" plaques and maybe a framed newspaper review; but every inch of the place covered with quotes of how great their food was... kind of made me a hater.  I missed In-N-Out.  Maybe it was because it was so hyped; but I was seriously underwhelmed by their food.  I paid over twelve dollars for a bacon cheeseburger; smallest fries; and smallest drink.  I started to doubt the quotes on the walls since \""Best Value\"" seemed to be the wording on several of them.  Now; the burger.  Let me start out by saying I really really really like burgers.... I can't really say this or that place is best; because I seriously like alllll of them.  Whether it be the super-processed flavor of McDonald's to the flamed-broiled goodness that is Burger King; or even the super fresh taste of In-N-Out;  I love burgers.  I love how not every burger tastes the same.  I looove burgers.  I don't think there has been a burger I haven't finished.  However; I literally had a moment to myself where I thought to myself I didn't want to finish this.  It was a fleeting thought; but that shocked me.  It was that tasteless.   Whenever I create an opinion on ANYTHING; I like to do the research and try it out before creating my own.  Every single bite; I was trying to find the great-awesome-spectacular-best-of-(insert city)-awesome-value-better-than-In-N-Out-burger taste everyone was talking about on the 'net.  I could not find it.  T.T  I ordered it with \""Everything\"" and everything was bleh.    But don't hate me.  Like I said; I really like to do the research and try things out before I cement my opinion on something.  Sooooooo; I'm giving Five Guys 1 Star this time around for their underwhelming; super-overpriced burger.  However; I will go back once or twice because I love burgers and I like to give them the benefit of the doubt.  Maybe the guy behind the grill forgot to season my patty?  Maybe my tastebuds took the day off?  Stay tuned for my updated review of Five Guys!""",jvvh4Q00Hq2XyIcfmAAT2A,"To me this place is 3.5 stars. I'm not dying to go back; so I rounded down to a 3. The burger was tasty for a fast food joint and reasonably priced. A big plus is choosing what you want on it. It was a little greasy; but everything seemed fresh. A step above Johnny rockets type place; but I have in n out a step above five guys. Nothing really stood out. The cajon fries were saturated in oil and were just not good at all. I really wanted to love it; but I just \liked\"" it.""",jvvh4Q00Hq2XyIcfmAAT2A,What can I say about Five Guys other than I'm so glad it finally made its way to Arizona. The burger is tasty; the fries are delicious; and it's super close to my house. My only beef with this place (haha get it..) is that it's pretty expensive for 2 people. For my boyfriend and I; it came out to almost $20 for 2 burgers; 2 fries; and 1 drink. That's pretty bad considering we can go to Chili's and spend the exact same amount. If I had to pick between here and In-N-Out; which I also love; I'd probably go to Five Guys even though I don't recommend it often because you'll probably have a heart attack :),jvvh4Q00Hq2XyIcfmAAT2A,Definitely a tasty burger; however VERY over-priced. A burger; fries and drink ran me just under $12. I will NEVER like a burger and fries that much from a fast food joint. They have a really cool touch screen soda machine though that is top notch. Good; but waaayyy too expensive.,jvvh4Q00Hq2XyIcfmAAT2A,Definitely a tasty burger; however VERY over-priced. A burger; fries and drink ran me just under $12.

Good; but waaayyy too expensive.,n-iA7O3vKAgCMk3Caf2Syw,My friend took me here and I was surprised this place has good subs. I've always been a fan of subway but this place is up there; too. The subs also taste healthier. It's a nice restaurant with a fire station theme to it which is neat. The pricing isn't too expensive but it is more than subway but it tastes good. The subs here have that fresh taste to them.,n-iA7O3vKAgCMk3Caf2Syw,I love the firehouse theme; and like how the restaurant pays tribute to firefighters. The food was just okay to me though. It tasted just a tad bit better than Subway; and it was more expensive than $5 footlongs - so I'd doubt I'll return to Firehouse Subs.  I ordered The Engineer sandwich - packed with turkey; lettuce; tomatoes; onions; and mushrooms. There wasn't many mushrooms in my sandwich :( I really do like the original hot sauce. Definitely add that to any sandwich you try there. Maybe if I had kids I would bring them to this place; the kids meal comes with a complimentary firefighter hat.,n-iA7O3vKAgCMk3Caf2Syw,I work within walking distance to Firehouse Subs. I don't frequent it much because it is only okay in my opinion. Today I had the best sandwich I've had from Firehouse yet. I had the steak and cheese (minus cheese cause I'm lactose intolerant); with peppers and onions on wheat. Delicious but I've had a stomach ache since. I guess that's not saying much because I get a stomach ache whenever I eat almost anywhere. The Italian is pretty good too. Slightly expensive.   Oh; and if you are getting their cherry limeade from the machine make sure you put sprite in it as well; because I'm pretty sure it's just cherry syrup.,n-iA7O3vKAgCMk3Caf2Syw,After spending Halloween handing out candy with my parents in the East Valley we were super hungry on our way home; about 9:45.  I always get nervous going into places like this right before closing time because I used to work at Paradise Bakery; and I know what a pain it is to clean up after just one stupid sandwich.  These guys definitely didn't show any displeasure.  We were warmly greeted with nary an evil eye in sight.    The decor is super themed but cute.  I like the cheese thank you very much.  The employees are even in a sort of fire fighter uniform.  Their menu is diverse enough to make most people happy.  I was really hungry so I ordered the Firehouse Hero; a trio of roast beef; turkey; and honey ham.  The meats and cheese are steamed before hand to seal in extra juice and just make it really good.  Nice touch.  The bread was exactly the way I like it; sort of soft; sort of crusty.  The meats all tasted really great and were actually distinguishable from one another; unlike other certain sub shops.  The honey ham was my favorite; it was really sweet and really good.  I wouldn't mind if they brought one of these Downtown.  Good sandwiches for a good price.,n-iA7O3vKAgCMk3Caf2Syw,Firehouse Subs is a great sandwich place.  The food is great and the employees are always very friendly and helpful.  The atmosphere is nice and they also have one of those cool soda machines.  I work in the same plaza and my company has ordered a sandwich tray from them for lunch many times.  It's always ready on time and reasonably priced.,n-iA7O3vKAgCMk3Caf2Syw,I judge my lunch and dinner places to a different set of criteria.  For lunch it's about convenience; cost; and taste.  A distant fourth criterion might be the relative nutritional value of the meal.  Firehouse; wins on the first three and is worthy of inclusion into the lunch time rotation.  The sandwiches are hearty; heavy; and tasty.  Denser and more robust flavors then you'd get at the chain sub spots.  I doubt that this place will win any accolades from the American Heart Association but I also doubt that 85% percent of its patrons even consider calorie counts when they order one of these sandwiches.    A great sub.  Just make sure you eat fruits; vegetables; and other healthy options when you're not here.,n-iA7O3vKAgCMk3Caf2Syw,"The Steak &Cheese were first rate; lots of meat & cheese; good bread (ordered 2 large). The Smokehouse Cheedar was good but very heavy on BBQ sauce; so if you don't want a sandwich overwhelmed by  & dripping of BBQ Sauce I recommend you tell them to limit it or eliminate it. The sandwich was full of meat and otherwise excellent. The Oatmeal Raisin cookie is entirely too sweet for my taste....too much brown sugar in that recipe.   I returned the next day. I tried the large Pastrami Sub; it was loaded with meat & cheese; but was also topped with a healthy helping of lettuce and tomatoes.   Unfortunately; while the sandwich was very tasty (and filling!) I became ill a couple of hours latter and spent too much time in the restroom for the balance of the day. Since this was my only food for the day; the lettuce and tomatoes become suspect (since they were the only change to the sandwich I'd had the day before which was meat and cheese only).  The two other sandwichs were a repeat of the Steak & Cheese with onions and those guests; loved them and had no illness problems (neither sandwich comes with lettuce or tomatoes).   It's been good enough for me to return; but it'll be \meat & cheese only\"" from now on for me.  These subs are about $7.50 - $8.00 for a 12 inch. You really can't compare them to a Subway Footlong; since the Footlong is often $5 and the $2.50 - $3.00 additional cost at Firehouse should be expected to buy a better more meat/cheese filled sub (which it does).  BTW; on my second visit; the very pretty cashier repeated my order back to me three times...incorrectly; I really expected something would be wrong when I received my food;  but in the end; she got it right :-).""",n-iA7O3vKAgCMk3Caf2Syw,Gosh the selection of hot sauces here makes this my favorite sub shop. I love the Poison sauce. Good prices; delicious food. Try it if you haven't already!!,n-iA7O3vKAgCMk3Caf2Syw,Maybe I'm just caught up in the moment; but on my neverending quest to find the best sub; I think I finally found it.  I can't believe it took me so long to try this place out; but I'm so glad I did.  I ordered the hot pastrami combo.  At first I thought it was a little pricey ($8.00) but that was before I took my first bite.  It only took one bite and I knew I was onto something special.  It all starts with the bread.  It was fresh; warm and very tasty.  The melted cheese; sauce; lettuce; onion and pastrami were incredible when all rolled into one bite.  Not much else to say except try it for yourself.,n-iA7O3vKAgCMk3Caf2Syw,"Absolutely our favorite sub shop of all time!  When Firehouse Subs opened in our neighborhood (Dana Park); we thought it would be \just another sub shop.\""  We were WRONG.  What fun to hear; \""Welcome to Firehouse;\"" yelled from their entire crew every time you walk in!  What fun to very often see police and firemen eating there (Firehouse gives first responders a price break; which I think is so cool).  All of Firehouse's subs are steamed hot.  They don't use one meat vendor ... they use the best meat vendor for that particular kind of meat to get the best!  I am a real fan of pastrami; but you can't usually find good quality pastrami in Arizona ... it's usually fatty and not great flavor.    At Firehouse; try the \""Steamer\"" which is a combo of pastrami and corned beef brisket; which is absolutely delectable!  The basic Steamer typically comes with Provolone; Mayo; Mustard and Italian Dressing ... but I think the quality of the meat and cheese is so yummy that I ask for it \""straight up\"" without the fixins!  Although I do ask for extra dill pickle spears ... they are the BEST.  My hub absolutely loves the Steak & Cheese Sub which can come with sauteed mushrooms and onions if you'd like.  Add jalapenos if you'd like a little zip.  If you've been going to Subway out of habit; I'd really encourage you to try something different in Firehouse Subs.  I don't think you'll end up going back to Subway.  If you have small children; Firehouse will give them a little plastic fireman's helmet to wear!  And there's a really good chance that fireman and/or policemen will be in the shop at lunch or dinner times ... has happened to me numerous times when there.    Although Firehouse Subs is a franchise that started in Florida; this truly feels like a local mom 'n pop joint to us.  We have gotten to know the franchisees for this location; Aaron; Linda and John.  Great; great people that have a great attitude to serve their customers.  I couldn't recommend Firehouse Subs in Dana Park more highly.""",n-iA7O3vKAgCMk3Caf2Syw,This was my first time eating here and my last! I am not a subway fan so I figured I would give this place a shot as it is near my house. Never have I had so big an issue with ordering a sandwich. When I walked in I took some time to look around the store and the menu to see what they had to offer. Big mistake! The lady at the counter gave me this look like I had spit on the floor or something. After about 5 mins of looking at the menu I decided to order the firehouse hero sandwich. Their prices are way more than I expected but figured if the sandwich was any good then it would be worth it.  As I paid for my sandwich and went to sit down I heard the counter lady say something like this guy needs to be going to Jenny Craig not here! I could not believe she would sit there and talk about a customer like that. Her personal feelings aside (btw aren't sandwiches supposed to be a healthy food option?) She should have kept it to herself. Or at least said it once I left. I am a big person but that has nothing to do with how I should be treated. As for the food I have to say I was not impressed. The Virginia honey ham was way to sweet for me. It had this weird almost maple syrup flavor that overpowered the rest of the sandwich. After 2 bites I was done. Bad service; high prices; and even worst food earn this place a nice spot on my never again list.,n-iA7O3vKAgCMk3Caf2Syw,"Firehouse is a solid sub shop and really isn't much more expensive than Subway.  They don't have a five dollar foot long; just better subs and a really cool soda machine.  The hot specialty subs are my favorite.  If I had to pick my favorite I would say its the \Engineer\"" but every sub I have ever ordered; at any location; has been good.  They are consistent; friendly and the subs are huge.  Get your sub \""fully involved\"" and there's no way you're leaving this establishment hungry.  If I want a sub sandwich and there is a Subway and Firehouse sitting across the road from each other; I'm going to Firehouse because the food is better and lets face it; firefighters are a lot cooler than Jared.""",WAqACt7FfSFcJs-gqysIlQ,Today was the first time I ate In-N-Out here in Arizona and I'm proud to say that it was delicious. I've never been a fan of burgers; but In-N-Out was always the exception when I lived in California. It's something about the buns that make it so yummy. Anyways; I ordered a #2: a cheeseburger; fries; and a medium drink. Of course I animal styled them fries. Mm! So mouth watering. Their pink lemonade is really great too. If you're ever here; definitely give it a try.  The prices are so affordable. I never really checked out the prices when I used to live in California because I was never the one to buy the food so I never noticed how cheap everything is. I mean; it's seriously affordable. The meal is about $5.30 (+ tax) which is a normal meal price I guess; but the quality of the food is just perfect that you truly get your money's worth.

I really do feel sorry for east coasters when it comes to cheap; fresh; awesome burgers.,WAqACt7FfSFcJs-gqysIlQ,It had been 4 years since I last ate In-N-Out Burger in SF; so my friend and I got super excited to find out that Phoenix has In-N-Out nearby a location I was visiting on business trip as well!  I learned from the last time I ate that animal style can make the food felt/taste sickening (the sauce was great..but it was way too much to have it on both burger and fries); so I strategically scaled down the animal style to just my fries :). We each got a cheeseburger with onions; animal-style fries and soda along with chocolate milk shake.  It cost just around $10-11 total for each of us but the taste and the effort to drive here solely for our last lunch destination in Phoenix was great! The vegetables in the burger were so fresh!! I love the fresh veggie crunch in each bite! I must admit that I definitely cannot have this type of food everyday or  evenon a weekly basis (given the calories and the unhealthi-ness probably most optimal to indulge in this ritual just quarterly or yearly)..but after such a long time; it felt great to reunite with this food chain again!!,Zw4CvOwXJj1QA85SvB99Hw,This is one of my favorite chain fast food places.  Everything seems pretty fresh and can be a bit more healthy than your typical fast food fare.  This location is just like all the rest.  It is clean; the staff is friendly; and the prices all seem to be reasonable (though I think a bit higher than they should be for what you get).  The line can get pretty long during peak times; but it seems to move pretty fast.  I always get the same thing:  a bowl or salad with chicken although I don't know how a bowl and a salad are different.  Anyway; I get lettuce; chicken; corn salsa stuff; hot salsa and shredded cheese.  LOVE it!  Light on the carbs but probably high in calories...oh well...I try.  Pro Tip:  If you want cheese; sour cream and/or guacamole; order it on the side.  Even if you say you want a little bit; they will put heaps on your bowl/salad.,Zw4CvOwXJj1QA85SvB99Hw,Usually when you roll something this good; it's illegal. While I wouldn't consider it authentic Mexican (more like Mexican style); It's the best thing to get for the price. I get so excited moving along in the line; watching as they scoop the delectable ingredients onto the warm tortilla. There are few things better than seeing a middle aged Mexican woman muscle the burrito into its final shape. When they hand me that baby sized burrito I feel like a little kid on Christmas morning. It's the perfect amount of food and always leaves me satisfied.,Zw4CvOwXJj1QA85SvB99Hw,"I love Mexican food; even the \fake\"" kind that other people complain about. Well; I'm not complaining! Tacos; burritos; quesadillas;  taco bowls; chips and salsa- I love them all! I like how the price doesn't change if you choose steak instead of chicken. Some of the other toppings cost extra; but only get what you want and can afford. I like to add veggies to my tacos for an extra charge; but I know it's worth it for some vegetables in my meal.

I came here with a friend and figured it was time to try.  I've heard so much about this place!  Mostly good; of course.  I came in and noticed that the menu is simple and prices were fair.  I liked the selections available; and went with the steak fajita burrito. I got to choose my options; and it came wrapped up nice in tin foil.  I really liked the burrito I got!  I will probably be back again to eat here.,Zw4CvOwXJj1QA85SvB99Hw,I can't believe I haven't written a review about the wonderful Chipotle (I can spell it; can't pronounce it). I am always greeted with a friendly staff and a clean restaurant! Then here is a yelpers favorite part: the food is consistently great! I have never had a bag thing a Chipotle. Everything is wide open so you can see everything being cooked and made for you. How cool is it that you can actually wave to the people making your food. I always love places that open their kitchen up to their guests. It shows they have nothing to hide. The only bad thing... Catch them at a lunch rush and you could be waiting awhile. A small price to pay for freshly cooked food!  And just in case you were wondering... I am eating it right now :),Zw4CvOwXJj1QA85SvB99Hw,"This location at Tempe Marketplace has to be the best one yet. For starters the large amounts of parking available. The convenience of the mixture of the eye candy at midweek lunch time (ASU hot girls and business suited short skirted hot heeled women!) Oh yeah and the food!  I thought to myself what am I going to eat on my high protein diet? Mexican? Nope mexican't too much carbs; but wait my carb watching protein eating calorie counting friends. The Chipotle salad is our salvation of eating with out looking like boring dieter.   The chicken salad bowl with no rice; beans; pico and salsa is perfect! Top it off with a little bit of lemon juice and you got a great healthy lunch and with a water you got it all for under $7. Yes my friends we can eat; healthy; cheap and good.

I don't stray far from the basic nuggets- but have had a chicken sand which and I also enjoy the chicken strip salad.   The shakes are really tasty as well!  My whole family likes chic-fil-a; and that is pretty rare -my whole clan to agree on something. Price is what you expect for a fast food place-no dollar menu here though-about $7 for a meal.   Staff is always very pleasant and you won't get out of there without hearing \its our pleasure\"".   Drive through is always pretty long at lunch time but moves quick.

Will not return.,5nddZwZzT7pvC5vBjKRzoA,Fast food is not really my thing; but I really like this Chick-Fil-A. Other than the food being pretty good (amazing for fast food) but they have Family Nights on Thursdays (http://www.cfarestaurant.com/santanvillagemarketplace/events). I assume the other Chick-Fil-A's do as well; but I've only seen them advertised at this particular location. I took my children there tonight and for $15 (cost of dinner) my 5-year old was able to make a sock snowman craft (turned out really cute); have face-painting (by a professional; not a bored teenager) and a balloon animal (or princess; buzz light-year; batman; whatever the case may be). I was thoroughly impressed with the event and can't wait to go back for the next one.  Besides all that; the restaurant was clean. The food was fresh and the chicken wasn't gross. The staff was super friendly and uber polite. I was fan! Great place to spend the evening with your family.,5nddZwZzT7pvC5vBjKRzoA,Real White chicken. Waffle fries fun. Expensive for ckicken; but its not chicken parts. Love the fact it's closed Sundays!,jCldB0wUJU9A_ti45vZ0bg,Always busy at this location. The staff is friendly; polite; and helpful.

This location is always clean; bright; and even the bathrooms are clean too.  The food is good enough.  I usually get a salad and its pretty yum. The guacamole is worth the price of admission.

One of my favorite quick places to grab a bite to eat that I don't feel guilty over eating. I rated this particular Chipotle at a four star because their line moves incredibly slowly compared to other Chipotle's in the valley. Friendly group though and upbeat. The new sofritas are awesome.,jCldB0wUJU9A_ti45vZ0bg,Good food; service ok.  Thought $1.95 extra for a tablespoon of guacamole was a little pricey!,jCldB0wUJU9A_ti45vZ0bg,Yum! This place never disappoints. The food is always fresh; hot; and delicious. Some items are organic; some meats are not from animals raised on pesticides and other poisons...you get a choices at least. For me it's better to skip the tortilla and avoid the additional approx 200 calories and go with the Burrito Bowl. The taco's are good but not a good value when compared to the rest of the menu items (portion to price ratio).  Oh except for the crazy $1.80 price for a teaspoon sized portion of guacamole (I skip that too). Very good place to eat it's nice and quick.  The staff are friendly!,jCldB0wUJU9A_ti45vZ0bg,"I actually love Chipotle; especially when they're \attempting\"" to phase out gmos. BUT this location needs to have more workers on the Fridays and Saturdays when it's late. It gets busy and feels like I'm iniatially being pushed by the workers to order fast; but then made to wait at the 'second' station; while they help the next people.  I mean geesh; at least get a decent number of staff. The place is certainly getting enough extra money out of us. The one by my work is a lot more generous. The manager of this place can also be rude. I once went in unsure of what to order and decided I did not want anything as my boyfriend stood in line to get his own. The manager went from extremely helpful to suddenly offended and too important to notice us once I decided not to order. How childish. I used to go there all the time; he could have  remained courteous to regulars. But his flip flopping attitude isn't the whole problem. What I loathe is this location and a few others are price gouging for guacamole. I ALWAYS get the veggie bowl with guac at no charge. But this place is suddenly charging (while the one by my work isn't); so I definitely feel gipped. Especially; when I have no interest in their new Sofritas -which are meh. I feel like the new tofu option is just a way to justify the extra charge for veggie bowls and frankly; it's not adequate. I tried it and I go without it. To make this particular Chipotle seem even more stingy; they now claim they are \""not supposed to\""  give out a side of cilantro. Really! I just gave you the extra $1.59 and now the cilantro is suddenly valuable too!? Puh-leeze. But I'm sure they will charging for herbs soon. I will not go to this location anymore; I could ignore the manager but not the attempt to nickel and dime us for every bit of food-even freaking seasoning.""",jCldB0wUJU9A_ti45vZ0bg,"Having three orders and wanting to bring my food home; I decided to use the option of placing an order online. Upon completion; my order was said to be placed and ready for pickup at 6:00. When I got here at 6:00; I skipped the long; long; long line and headed up to the front cash register (this feels inherently wrong; but the site encourages you that this is the way pickup is done; and the line is to be skipped; why else wait throughout the ordering process?). The cashier notified me that she did not have any orders placed for pickup. In other words; despite receiving confirmation online; my order was not ready or even sent to the location. I had to recall my order from memory while the cashier jotted it down on a piece of paper and sent it to the front of the line to be made. I waited a total of 30 minutes for my order to be made. Yes; I was offered a drink and extra chips; and they discounted my price by maybe 30%; but I was definitely not expecting to wait 30 minutes for the long line to dissolve before they began making my order. Had I known; I would have just stood in line or left altogether (although; I was really craving Chipotle..).  Bottom line is; do not rely on \pick up\"". Bring a confirmation with you; at least. Or you may just opt to stand in line. Would most likely be the quickest option.  The cashier who helped me was very cosiderate - it was out of her control and you could tell she felt bad. Wish I would have gotten her name for reference. When she was trying to help me out; the manager seemed uninterested and offered a quick \""yeah; sure\"" when she pressed him about discounting. I know this place gets busy; and I was by no means demanding a discount; just a bad situation altogether.""",aCwCa7QMycZInFChAGU9pQ,Their food is over priced; but worth it all. Everything about this place is amazing. Their bathroom is spotless and the inside of this place is ridiculously clean. I love how all the sauces; napkins; utensils are right there for you instead of having to ask the workers. Omg! Their chick-fil-a sauce is so good!!!   If ever you see a chick-fil-a; don't drive pass it. You all need to get a taste of the good life! This place is literally heaven.,XiCnbGY6R92Ji7r38jceZA,Well Hello There;  I must do a review here at Chick-fil-A on 16th Street and Camelback. This place is so clean; professional; and calm. I love the d_cor it is so cute and cozy and it promotes a longer stay and with that comes more money. But it is worth every dollars; dollar; pennies; penny; cents; and cent (Hahahaha) if you get my drift. They can have it! (Hahahaha)   The service I received was stellar by a man at the register named Vandell. He is customer service with a smile and with a friendly and professional demeanor. Boy; that man is awesome. I have never seen anything like it in fast food. I hope he is getting paid what he is worth. Or that would be a total shame on Chick-fil-A!   NOW THE FOOD: The regular chicken sandwich $3.19 minus the pickles was ohhhhhh sooooooo AMAZING! I have dismissed this restaurant brand for many reasons over the years to only discover: I WAS AN IDIOT! (Hahahaha) And I must be honest I was being cheap because a chicken sandwich just doesn't appeal to me or my wallet. But boy was I wrong; wrong; wrong; and I have missed out all these years. The sandwich was so juicy with every bite that I had to look at it and really look at it with every bite and to ask myself: IS THIS QUALITY REALLY HAPPENING RIGHT NOW?  Man; YES IT WAS! I pulled out a waffle fry and with no salt to ensure its freshness and (I don't eat salt when cooking anyway) so the fries must be salt free. These fries were piping hot and perfectly crisp. The large fry was the perfect size for the meal. I didn't feel cheated in portion in any way. The fries were so hot; fresh; and crisp that I just couldn't resist another large fry. And for $1.95 for a large one; why should I not get another. GREEDY I know but OHHHHH well; they were just that magnificent. And McDonalds will not see me on fry excursions anymore! Waffle fries come to mamma! I will be glad to give you my $1.95 anytime! (Hahahaha)   The drink was so perfect in carbonation that I really enjoyed the ice cold Coke. Now should I have to say anything else? Oh yeah and by the way; I saw a salad at the table across from me and it was the prettiest green salad I have seen in a long time. I just cannot leave that out of this review.   I will be having many salad rendezvous' because the one I saw was so pretty and green. Trust me go try it and eat it! I did not go at a rush hour so if that may make a difference go when it's not busy. Enjoy and think of me sitting in a booth somewhere with no salt on my fries and my juicy grin; from my juicy sandwich. And these sandwiches have a super soft bun that does not over power the quality of the meat. Well enjoy and now I must go make up for my Chick-fil-A ignorance over all these years. (Hahahaha)   C-Ya with a new piece of chicken already in my hand! (Hahahaha),XiCnbGY6R92Ji7r38jceZA,Service is above and beyond;  chicken is great...  The prices are insanely high. Still don't understand why it's so busy.  I have a business meeting nearby every week and come here when I am early;  out of the 40 times I have been here I have only eaten here 3 times.. What,XiCnbGY6R92Ji7r38jceZA,The best chicken sandwich you're going to get in the fast-food world. Kids meals are good and the toys on offer are usually books or something else more interesting than a sad-ass commercial tie-in (like at McD's.) Employees who act like they're treated as something better than indentured servants.  But . . .   Portions kinda small; prices kinda high. A good option but not quite the second coming others make it out to be.,XiCnbGY6R92Ji7r38jceZA,I absolutely love and support chick fil a and was please to hear they would open one by me. But since they have opened I have had nothing but problems; atleast on their drive thru. The first time I let it go. The second time I called to let them know; then the second time I was put on hold while an employee talked with another employee on how there was a complaining costumer in the line. At that point I was livid. Hung up and wrote a complaint on their website. Finally of weeks of not going there I finally decided to try it again and once again I was disappointed. The food is great it just seems like their costumer service sucks. There is no difference now from that place and mcdonalds next door,XiCnbGY6R92Ji7r38jceZA,"Somewhere between Costco and Starbucks I got hungry; and I didn't want samples. I spotted Chick Fil A on my way to get my afternoon caffeine fix; I said to my self; \oh sure why not\"" Now it's been years since I ate there; last time was in Metro Center and I wasn't quite impressed.    First of Parking sucks here; especially with a full sized truck but I ended up across in front of Verizon since I'm still able to walk. I spotted three employees at the corner of the building; and figured that's where the entrance was; so in I went.   This place rocks. I wasn't more than 5 feet inside the store and I was greeted by a young man manning the registers; \""not bad\"" I told my self. There was another couple in front and an older lady stepped up and took my order. I went for the #2 and thought to my self it was gonna be another BK; McD's type of chicken patty. I ordered was given a cone and started to find a seat; must've wandering around for about 30 seconds before I chose a seat but by that time my meal was ready.   The chicken \""patty\"" was an entire chicken breast!!!! Nuff said. From a guys prospective; its a done deal; leave me alone; I'm eating; who cares about the decor....I'm eating.

I recently came in here with my pops for a quick bite to eat and we were greeted the moment we walked into the door. The cashier was super patient with us; being that we had no idea what to order. He was so nice to use the entire time we were there. I wish I would have gotten his name and given him a compliment to his manager.  Our food was served to us very shortly after placing our order; which was almost troubling since I did not think they had time to make it properly; but it was fantastic. I would love to go here more often.,XiCnbGY6R92Ji7r38jceZA,This place is ok.  The inside appeared nice; but I did have the time to dine in.  The food seemed a little overpriced for fast food.  The food was ok.  In all fairness to Chick-Fil-A; I never ate here as a kid; so I have no fond childhood memories to draw from.  Several of my friend that love this chain have loved it since childhood.  I'm not quite sure what all the fuss is about over this chain.,XiCnbGY6R92Ji7r38jceZA,They have screwed up several orders and one order was missing a sandwich...so instead of inviting me back in right away to get the sandwich; they sent me a coupon for a cheaper sandwich.

Love it!!,nvuw2UgZV-Y-WEmHOaLRkg,We came here today after a very long walk. Chick Fil A is the place man.  This is the king or should I say the Queen of fast food. I know they have all the political stuff going on; but let us just deal with the food at this moment. The chicken here is divine~ I mean really good! I love the fries ; cut fresh from a potato and just fried. They are fat and just perfect waffle fries. They use real green lettuce; find that any where else.  I even got a lemonade; which is made from real lemons; sugar and pure water. Of course they do have sauces and dips with good old High fructose corn syrup in it. But; you almost have to leave the country to find a place without it. The food is great! The staff is well mannered and friendly; and the price is good. I say that is all I need. Right O! Plus; the staff all gets Sunday off; I give the owner major props for that . It is a really good thing.,nvuw2UgZV-Y-WEmHOaLRkg,It's CFA; what's not to like?!

Oh and you get get beer here and margaritas too . I am absolutely in love with this place and can't get enough. Chipotle can get crowded on the weekends and during lunch hours but you can still go in and and get your food in under 15 minutes.,WcGTSRku3mrVK7V9GKq4UQ,I love Chipotle.  They offer huge burritos as well as you can skip the tortilla and get a bowl.  They also will make cheese crisps for children.  Prices are $5.50-$6.00.  You can have anything made into a salad for an additional $0.50.  They can get crowded on the weekends; but you can also fax or do your order online and just pick it up.  We love going to Chandler Mall and get the kids a meal inside and we get Chipotle for us.  Best bargain there!,WcGTSRku3mrVK7V9GKq4UQ,Chipotle is dependable. I can always count on them to give me a great; delicious and fulfilling meal at a good price.,WcGTSRku3mrVK7V9GKq4UQ,Every time I've ever eaten here I've gotten grizzly pieces of steak in a Steak Burrito. When you are paying double the price of Filibertos to come here it is pretty frustrating to bite into that. The price is competitive with other major chains. The environment inside is very nice and minimalistic. The chips are delicious but are caked in salt. The salsa is good. Look up the secret menu.,WcGTSRku3mrVK7V9GKq4UQ,I love the food here the only thing is it can get pricey.  The burritos are huge and come with rice; beans; meat; salsa; lettuce; sour cream and other options. You can also choose a bowl instead of burrito the has all the same choices like a taco salad. They have a few things for the kids to get also.,WcGTSRku3mrVK7V9GKq4UQ,I love chipotle and go at least once a week and usually more. I always get the exact same thing....bowl with brown rice; lettuce and steak or a three point meal they ALWAYS say; as this is a little cheaper than the regular bowl.  Today the girl at the register and I believe the manager were so rude. They told me all the other Chipotle's haven't been charging me enough and basically arguing with me in front of everyone.  I can't believe the service at this place; it was so bad. I will never go back to this Chipotle.,WcGTSRku3mrVK7V9GKq4UQ,Oh; Chipotle. So delicious; yet so punishing later. I'm all for giant burritos; but damn. Chicken is win. Also; how come guacamole is extra? Are avocados really that expensive? I didn't think so last time I bought some. And didn't I just pay like $9 for a burrito and drink? Meh.,ff_QnODW0vqNWZPSTVQTsQ,I could eat subs for lunch every single day and never tire of subs.

If you get a chance; try this place.,ff_QnODW0vqNWZPSTVQTsQ,I love Goodcents way better than Subway.  Their bread; meats and cheeses are so fresh.

Just an FYI I get the veggie sub on wheat. My wife like their tuna sub Goodcents is super clean and super efficient.  Easy parking lot to get in and out of as well  FOOD: Excellent sub sandwiches. They don't skimp on their toppings.  When I want a sub I choose this place over Subway. PRICE: Very reasonable. SERVICE:  Fast; friendly service. Very personable; Sam kept our soda and iced tea filled to the brim. CONCULSION: There's really not much to say; I've never had a bad tasting sandwich from there and they have never messed up. Makes me wonder how I put up with subway all these years.  RETURN  FACTOR: 100%  ************************* What does my OVERALL rating mean?*************************  5 stars -Highly recommended.

Most inconsistent fast food place; these days I have to search for chicken or steak in my chicken/steak bowl. What's going on? Why is this place being so skimpy on the meat? No and I do not appreciate Chipotle trying to sneak an approve for antibiotic fed meat.  I do not want to pay $6.50 for a bowl of rice and beans. There maybe relation between Chipotle's stock price ($400+) and their quality. Higher the stock price; more wall street expectations of more profits and lower quality.,-p-9eBYvts8tcalo5IWOKw,The food is excellent ! Great price/quality; the food is always fresh!

I've tried the competitor and it was just missing something...probably that unique Chipotle flavor.    I've been doing my taxes lately and so I've been reviewing all of my receipts for quick meals.  When I see that I've spent more money on a fast-food meal than I did on a very satisfying Chipotle meal; I want to kick myself for ever having strayed!

What's not to love...right?,-p-9eBYvts8tcalo5IWOKw,The food is delicious and a great price; however this review is in regards to how I witnessed employees treating what appeared to be a new trainee.

The food is really good and pretty cheap.,LaRo1F0bOEZo4p11bfkshA,Prob one of the best of the fast food type burger places but way overrated. They definitely have a cult following.  I have to say the burger is really good especially as animal style (one of the not so secret menu options). It is so small though you have to get at least a double or even a triple to be satisfied (3x3 good option). So once you have ordered a 3x3; animal style you got a nice sized burger that has all the right cheese gooeyness; grilled onion and sauce to boot. (prob is it hikes up the price).  I have to say the fries just suck (these are fighting words to the in-n-out lovers). They are cut fresh but they don't cook them right. They are soggy little suckers so i have to say Fry well (or well done) to get them in some sort of crispiness but then they are almost cooked to much. So i usually don't order anymore. They need to learn how to do the twice cook method (blanch then crisp)  Shakes are ok but nothing special what so ever. I do like how they have little hot yellow chiles if you want them.,LaRo1F0bOEZo4p11bfkshA,Honestly; how can you go wrong with In-N-Out?

Since I appear to be the only person I know not on the Five Guys bandwagon; I decided to give this location a try. I'm still not jumping on board.   There's nothing wrong with the location. Cityscape is a great spot in downtown Phoenix. Perfect for the busy lunch crowd; and Five Guys is open for dinner and on weekends. For a fast food burger in this area; it pretty much is as good as it gets. The location is very clean and the staff was very friendly.

I learned my lesson from the Scottsdale location; and ordered the Little Hamburger this time. It's a good size and not too unreasonably priced; but still more than I want to pay for a quick service meal. The huge amount of toppings are wonderful (but I cannot figure out how all the toppings are free yet cheese is an additional 60 cents). It's also a little too messy and greasy to me; but that's probably what appeals to others.   The big problem I have with Five Guys is the fries. Why is there no small? The amount that comes in a regular order is way too much. While you certainly get the value of what you pay for in the quantity; there should be a smaller and cheaper option. You also do not get the value of what you pay for in quality. This time I experimented with the Cajun Fries. Just awful. Way too overseasoned and soggy. I left out the cup so my coworkers could finish them off. Not too many people seemed interested.   A little more than seven dollars for a burger and an unnecessary amount of fries.

I was enticed to eat at this new downtown location because I had been so impressed with the french fries served at their south Phoenix restaurant.  The fries served here were terrible. My dining partner commented on how soggy and unappetizing they were and took them back to only have them replaced with equally depressing pile of soggy; soft fries. His experience in fast food restaurant management told him all he needed to know by watching them cook the fries. They overload the fryer baskets and never account for time required to bring the oil back up to the proper heat. The result is a soggy fry that tastes more boiled than fried.  A real disappointment and an expensive one at that. Most of my fries remained uneaten and the burger was greasy and flavorless. Quality control is not a priority here; but they are quite efficient at taking your hard-earned cash.,qVN-P0aov4z5oknS12Cq1g,With Lenny's and Lucky's being so close; the burgers here are a late night compromise; only. I'd rather have a side of peanuts over the soggy fries; that is; if they'd let you. And really; their burgers are really just an expensive version of something you'd expect to get from a campground grill or the high school cafeteria.,qVN-P0aov4z5oknS12Cq1g,Wasn't impressed....my first time at Five Guys and not sure if it was the chain overall or the location. Service was good; so I'm thinking I'm just an In N Out girl? Ordered a bacon cheeseburger; fries; and drink. Burger was just ok (way too big for me with the double patty; but I thought it'd be a single); fries were not good...just too expensive for what I got,qVN-P0aov4z5oknS12Cq1g,Tried this in Tempe but in a quick moment of haste I asked for the works and it came that way - my mistake as I hate ketchup and Mayo on burgers as it disguises the flavors and both were included; but that was my fault.  Vowed to try it again and when I did I omitted those offenders and it was great.  Came out promptly; result was good; tasty and far better than the competition (In-N-out ).  Mid priced burger was good value and the burger seemed of comparable caliber for price.  The meat was flavorful; the bun soft and they sported crisp veggies.  Order was exactly correct on delivery. A bit pricey; but not that bad overall.  Free peanut starters are a real plus as you wait - somebody was thinking on their toes for both client's hunger and preoccupation.   PS - Note on comments that compare this place to In-N-Out ; I do not consider them competition as I have seen In-N-Out as a filthy; dirty place where fries are scooped across the counter and back into the serving bin.  I searched on In 'N Out's website and it doesn't allow you to report it (like they don't care.  end of rant).,qVN-P0aov4z5oknS12Cq1g,Fan of Five Guys and adding all the toppings you can have on your burger without paying extra for it. Also love the fact they fill your bag up with fries; some of you neat freaks may not like this but re heated in a toaster oven they are even better. My recommendation is to share an order of fries because they really give you a lot. Also the drink machines are very futuristic at some locations don't be afraid to call for help if you don't know what you are doing.   This is good burger.

I could have fed two guys off of those fries (and I can eat a lot of fries). I am so glad that they have the Coca-Cola Freestyle machine! I have used this machine in another restaurant in Tennessee and became fascinated with it. You can pretty much make some crazy drink combinations; I had a Peach Mello Yello.

Really! :)  I ordered their \Little\"" cheese burger; which is a single patty burger.  I added my favorite toppings; mushrooms and onions; no extra cost (btw).  For sides; I ordered their Regular Cajun Fries that came in like a 16 oz. cup.  Excellent; seasoned very well and soft and tasted very; very POTATO-ee.  I would go back just for that.  The two problems to me were the BUNs and the PATTY.  If I didn't know any better; the buns were made of saw dust or card board! During the process of them compiling the burger; I did not see them toasting or buttering the buns like most places would.  The patty was not juicy or had that beefy flavor; I tasted mostly the DRY buns.  Same applied to my toppings; the mushrooms and onions. I felt the buns overrode everything!

That included mayo; ketchup; mustard; pickles; lettuce; tomato; grilled onions and grilled mushrooms. They had a bunch of other toppings too; but what I had was more than enough. I decided to go with the regular fries as opposed to the cajun fries; that they're supposedly known for. I do have to say I'm always impressed when burger joints have the hand-cut fries. They were good here; not the best I've ever had; but good. (That honor goes to my fave spot back in Washington; Burger Express). The burger was good; it seemed better than most people's experiences I think. it could be that they weren't crazy busy; as it was just after they opened on a Sunday. It was just what I wanted in a burger. Juicy; messy and a decent price. I still think Lenny's burgers are way better; but the fries here get the nod. Overall a cool little spot in downtown to get a decent burger and fries.""",qVN-P0aov4z5oknS12Cq1g,I just don't get the fascination with this place. They don't do a bad burger but they also don't do anything special either and still charge too much for it. I don't think their quality is that much higher over say jack in the Box or In N Out yet it's $10+ for a basic burger and some fries.  Sorry but if you are going to charge premium prices don't make a sub-par burger; if I am paying $7 for a basic cheeseburger don't tell me the only way you will make it is well done.   The fires are good but they aren't anything to write home about either; I do suggest them with the cajun seasoning though as it does add a little something.  The one plus they have going is free peanuts in the shell; not exactly sure how that ties into a burger joint but I still like them.,qVN-P0aov4z5oknS12Cq1g,In 'n' Out; I don't know how to tell you this; but . . . I've found someone else.  No; no; it's not like that; it was nothing you did!  Your burgers with their fresh toppings are delicious... but sometimes I just need a little change of pace; maybe something with grilled onions; grilled mushrooms; and bacon... mmm... bacon.  Oh; sorry.  You want to know the name?  I don't see why that...  You insist?  Okay... it's Five Guys.  Oh!  You're upset!  YOU'RE upset!  Well let me tell you what - Five Guys' fries are delicious; whether they come in Cajun OR regular!  And I NEVER liked your fries; In 'n' Out!  I just pretended to like them; but they're skinny; kind of limp; never flavorful; and you don't get very many.  Five Guys cuts 'em thick; salts them up; and pours an extra scoop into the bag; how do you like that!  And they give you FREE peanuts to munch on while you wait.  You never give me anything!  What?  No... you're right; Five Guys is a more expensive taste.  That's true; it is over $10 for a burger; fries; and drink; as opposed to your $5.  And I do have to park in a garage that loosely resembles a labyrinth designed by Escher.  But if you eventually make it up to the restaurant; they VALIDATE.  You have NEVER validated me!  Oh; that's right; you have surface parking; but don't try to pretend that's a feature with the temperature hitting 100!  You're ridiculous.  What's that?  Does Five Guys have milkshakes?  Uh... hm.  Milkshakes.  I never thought about that.  They don't.  Would you mind if I got my burger and fries from there and then came to you for the shake?  No?  Fine.  You're so overprotective and hyper-traditional sometimes.  Live a little.  I hope we can still be friends; In 'n' Out; but I just think I need to see other burgers.  Please don't pelt me with limp fries when I turn my back.,qVN-P0aov4z5oknS12Cq1g,"Fatburger and In-N-Out move over!  It was the weekend of CityScapes grand opening; and one of the busiest places was this burger joint. I came here with a friend between concerts; and was amazed by how great the burgers were! Here's the rundown:  The place: nice and clean (however; it was opened for only a few days when I went). They have boxes of peanuts sitting out for you to scoop a bunch and eat while in line; or sitting and enjoying your burger. I'm not a peanut fan; but I thought it was pretty cool! However; they make a mess; even with the crew cleaning the shells up constantly.  The service: friendly and fast. Now; when I went; about half of Phoenix was in the area because of CityScape; so it did take a while to get our burgers; but that was expected with a line out the door (that formed in a matter of minutes). I'm sure on a normal day; the service would be much quicker.  The price: it's...pricey. Yes; you get a good burger; and a \Small\"" is the size of a normal burger anywhere else; but almost $6? I felt like it was just a tad but too much. However; you can get almost anything you want on the burger for no additional charge. I didn't get fries or a drink (because of the price; and I already had a Pepsi in hand).   Overall; I'm impressed. So far; Five Guys wins my vote as the best burger in Phoenix.""",qVN-P0aov4z5oknS12Cq1g,The first time I tried 5 guys was here; downtown Phoenix! I had heard a lot about this company and their burger and fries. If you don't know what's up; this place charges a decent amount for a couple of patties because they don't charge for the toppings.  Fries are to die for; had the cajun ones and loved them. The burger was juicy and hot; and filled with all the flavors I love. The soda machine has endless possibilities for the soda nerd! I loved that; too!  The people at this location were nice and amazingly caring; even if they didn't know I had just come from the court and was a bit upset. That was a nice touch.  The only thing I wish I had was a cheaper menu; well and a little bit quieter of a radio.,qVN-P0aov4z5oknS12Cq1g,Find out where your little potatoes came from! That was so fun.     This is the place you come to enjoy a good burger before you head upstairs to enjoy a comedy show or a night of bowling with the pals. The fries come is  a huge paper bag underneath the juicy burger. The peanuts were the only thing I did not undersand about the GUYS menu. Well the peanuts are not on the menu but they were available. I felt like I was at the game again...     The price is right when you make it a combo night. So spurge and know your little french fries were once from Sugar Sugar City; ID! well not every night but mine were. Haha,qVN-P0aov4z5oknS12Cq1g,It was okay...  more topping choices; but no better than In and Out Burger. Twice as expensive. The fries were unique but i didn't care for them too much. It was cold and loud inside. Meh whatever.,cXykQLP4Sr3tNii8k-zckg,Best fast food I've ever had!   Had the butter burger; cheese curds; and a blizzard style custard with reese's pieces and cookie dough. When I got the food I was a little weary because it looked like really small portion sizes for the price; but everything is so high quality and delicious :),cXykQLP4Sr3tNii8k-zckg,"Went here for lunch because it was near. I had the red pepper double cheeseburger with bacon and fries and drink combo. Overpriced. Thin bacon. Nice BBQ sauce (asked for a container for the burger). Crinkle-cut fries I didn't like the taste of. Pepsi MAX tasted off. Overpriced. Near 8 bucks. You can take grandma; nice place; nice people; fast and friendly service. Clean. Overpriced. I enjoyed the burger but it went fast. Strange taste. I guess that was the \butter burger\"" taste. I'm not used to that. Overpriced. Burger King beats this place for flavor. Overpriced. Do they pay these prices in Wisconsin? I wasn't very full even after forcing down those fries.  Maybe your grandma will be.""",cXykQLP4Sr3tNii8k-zckg,Really wanted to like this place; but after three visits we are not fans.  - Location is clean and the employees are nice but not necessarily helpful. - Burgers are a higher quality for fast food but on the expensive side. - Fries are super greasy. - Cheese curds are nasty. - Custard is not much better than a dairy queen soft serve quality.  Every time we ate here; we felt like crap afterwards. So many better; cheaper fast food options.,cXykQLP4Sr3tNii8k-zckg,Really wanted to like this place; but after three visits we are not fans.  - Location is clean and the employees are nice but not necessarily helpful. - Burgers are a higher quality for fast food but on the expensive side. - Fries are super greasy. - Cheese curds are nasty. - Custard is not much better than a dairy queen soft serve quality.

Got to love the frozen custard concretes. That you can mix in any two things you want from there list of many. Inside tip: They also have chocolate custard not just vanilla. This I found out after a few visits. I always get chocolate custard with chocolate sauce and Oreo cookies. I think its the best. The burgers are really good. So are the onion rings and the cheese curds. I have never heard of cheese curds before Culvers. Must be a Wisconsin thing but they are really good. To call them fried cheese balls don't do them justice. Just try them. If you like cheese you will like these. The service is pretty good. Sure it takes awhile to get your food but that just means they are making it fresh. For that I am willing to wait. Plus they give you your concrete first so you can enjoy that while you pull forward in the drive thru to wait for the rest of your order. They give you a number and then bring out your food right to your car. It is a little expensive to eat more than once a week but it is well worth it.,cXykQLP4Sr3tNii8k-zckg,The food is super good!!! Love the Better Cheddar Burger with bacon and their root beer floats are out of this world!!! The customer service inside or drive thru is always awesome.  Very courteous!!! I was very please when I stopped while I was out Christmas shopping and stopped for a grilled cheese.  I did the basket and then asked for them to add a gift card.  They told me I could get the basket free because I was buying a gift card!!! whoo hoo!!!  LOVE CULVERS!!!!  The prices are reasonable and their concrete mixers are soooo good!!!!!,cXykQLP4Sr3tNii8k-zckg,Their food is pretty darn good!  Everything I have ordered there has been perfectly made so far.  I've stuck to getting the double cheeseburger combo; and Culver's has been consistent so far.    The cheese curds are a perfect side.    People might complain a little about the prices; but I'm pretty sure the prices at Culver's are still cheaper that a place like Carl's Jr.'s.    My daughters love that the kids meals come with frozen custard.  Culver's customer service is at the top of the food chain.  Go there and find out for yourself.    I couldn't find a single reason to deduct a point.,cXykQLP4Sr3tNii8k-zckg,Their food is pretty darn good!  Everything I have ordered there has been perfectly made so far.

The eating area is clean and much classier than your average booth at Burger King. There are large flat screen TVs with SpongeBob for the kids (or; you know; me) and ESPN for disinterested dads (or in my case; my boyfriend).  The burgers are about as good as you get them at Smashburger - but Culver's is a better value; in my opinion. For about $10 at Smashburger you can get fries; a drink; and a regular sized burger. At Culver's; for about the same price you can get a double burger; fries; and a medium concrete mixer.   So; yes; the burgers are wonderful; and the custard is as heavenly as it sounds. The fries; I'm pretty sure; were brought in from the closest frozen food section. (They didn't taste bad at all; just not like what you would expect at a restaurant.) The service was good; not perfect; but definitely acceptable.   I will definitely be back; but I still need to try Smashburger's Nutter Butter shake...,cXykQLP4Sr3tNii8k-zckg,Try the Fish Fry  I'm from Milwaukee; WI.  Land of the Friday Night Fish Fry.  My idea of the perfect fish fry is beer battered; potato pancakes w/applesauce; cole slaw and a salted caraway snack rye bread or roll.    Last Lenten season we tried a new place every Friday looking for anything that came close to what I love in Milwaukee.  No dice.  Chompie's for example had a good potato pancake; but the fish batter wasn't very good; cole slaw was blah and the bread was wrong (and it was like $12/$13; pricey for fish fry).  Last Friday I tried the Fish Fry at Culver's and it was good.  Ok; it didn't have the potato pancakes and the bread was wrong; but the fish and cole slaw was really tasty.  I liked the french frys and would deal with the dinner roll vs. rye bread.  Great value and quality fish fry.  I'm saving my 5 stars for the ultimate; throw down; it's just like home fish fry.  My only complaint about Culver's (besides Pepsi products; yuck) is that they have built this location close enough to my home that my girlish figure will surely suffer.   Haven't  started checking flavor of the day forecasts yet but summer will be here soon enough.,cXykQLP4Sr3tNii8k-zckg,WHAT.WHAT. The home of the Butter Burger(named so because the bun is buttered). These Burgers are made to order and will Karate chop your taste buds in the best way possible. The cheese curds will judo flip your buds as well. This place is giving my beloved In-N-Out a serious run for it's money. Would be 5 stars but it is a little pricey around $9 for a meal. But the service is superb (they bring your food out to you and will even pick it up for you and throw your trash away). Soleed man Soleed.,cXykQLP4Sr3tNii8k-zckg,I SO wanted to like Culver's. After finishing up an evening meeting we walked over to have dinner. We placed our order quickly and then went to fill our drinks. I know it was just after the rush hour but the drink station was a mess. There was liquid all over the place and straw paper wrappers everywhere.   The food was just so-so. I had a sour dough burger. The bread was mushy and the burger tasteless. Did not like the cheese curds at all. My husband had the fish and he said it was average. For what it cost; I'd rather go elsewhere.    One thing I loved; the quotes on the walls were nicely done and inspirational.  Good job here.,Pectv4bzzUVs0FQ6HQjW8g,The food here is pretty good. The ingredients seem fresh. I would probably compare them to Quiznos (maybe a little better).  The service is average. The prices are a little higher than normal.  I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come back. Just an average sub shop.,Pectv4bzzUVs0FQ6HQjW8g,Had lunch here for the first time a couple of days ago. We will return. Prices are fair and the sandwich was definitely yummy.  The place is spotless and the staff is helpful and friendly.    We each had the veggie sub and I would recommend it to everyone. One tip.  The large sub is huge. Order one large sandwich and split it.  Even a half sandwich is plenty. By yourself?  Order a small sub.  You will not be hungry when you leave.,Pectv4bzzUVs0FQ6HQjW8g,"I went to this place for the first time a couple of weeks ago. It's new and clean and of course it's got 'firemen' parafanalia all over. The staff was friendly and attentive. It had some interesting combinations and my food came out pretty quick. I enjoyed it and 1/2 a sandwich was just right for me. It was pretty much the same price as JerseyMike's but with more creative menu choices.  Let's just say this;  \It ain't Vita Mia's on Harrison Avenue in Garfield\""..... but you're not going to get better on the westside.  I give the Firehouse subs  a good solid 7 out of 10  Pepperoncini's.""",Pectv4bzzUVs0FQ6HQjW8g,"I was really surprised when I saw that so far; no one else has had the problems that I've had while going to firehouse.   I've been there probably 4 times. I get the same sub every time. There's usually like; 8 people working. The first time I went; everyone greeted me when I walked in; but they seemed bored. Zombie-fied. Like they were automatically programmed to say \Welcome to Firehouse\"" whenever the door opened.   The first time I went; there was a group of employees talking to a girl who seemed to be cleaning on the other side of the line. They asked her what time she got off. She said; \""Nine.\"" Well; when I got out of my care (parked right outside) my clock said 8:45ish. They asked her if she wanted to take a 10 minutes break. But...that didn't make sense; she gets off at nine...I guess it just seemed a little to...overstaffed. The feeling of having so many employees seems so lackadaisical when reflected onto the customer.   I will admit that an employ has never been rude; or made me feel awkward; and that's a huge plus.   Whenever I go; their drink machine is ALWAYS out of whatever flavored syrup I want to try. That have a cool machine that can make like; 300+ flavors or something. But whenever I get in line to get a combo I hear someone at the fountain going \""Oh; they're out of syrup\"" \""It's mostly water today.\"" \""Very watery; wonder if they're running low on supplies.\""   I don't think they serve any cold sandwiches on purpose--but I normally get either a steak or a chicken sandwich. Even though they're supposed to be warm; and there are like; 95320483209420394823 people on staff to get the job done; my sandwich is almost always either lukewarm or just barely warm. I don't want my sandwich to be mouth burning hot; but you know...I don't think I could change a mood ring's color with these sandwiches sometimes.   For that amount of people to be on a line; working on sandwiches all day every day; I expect them to be a certain tempurature--no; they can't determine what every customer's preference is. But you CAN wait for the sandwich to cool off. You CAN'T make the sandwich warmer; unless you're going home and are planning to put it in the microwave (can't do if you're on your lunch break; for most people.)   Personally; I feel like their 8 inch subs are a little teensy bit over priced for the lukewarm product I get at the end. I feel like I could get a perfectly warm sandwich at subway for probably a little bit less (footlong). But their bread trumps Subway's and Quizno's any day. It's a heavy competitor for JJ's. But that's no reason to raise the price a whole dollar and a half and then some.          TL;DR I like the place; but I feel like they're a little overstaffed and have some tiny kinks they need to work out. Including tweaks in pricing.""",Pectv4bzzUVs0FQ6HQjW8g,"A few people have told me that I need to try Firehouse Subs; so I finally got my chance today after a meeting up in Glendale .  This place has some unique concepts in both the food and d_cor.  They have a huge selection of hot sauces lined up to try; plus they provide small sauce cups to fill if you are getting it to go.  They also have the fancy new coke soda fountains that allow you to create your own blends of soda.  Of course; they also have several firehouse decorations and dedications to fire departments.    I chose to try the Italian sub; which had the usual combination of Italian meats and provolone.  I let them make it as described on the menu; plus their  \Fully Involved\"" combination of toppings.  I sort of missed the part that they serve almost all their subs warm; and I was actually picking it up about an hour before I was going to have lunch; so I feel like I can't accurately judge it.  I think it would have definitely been better fresh at the shop.  The flavors of the sandwich were more sweet than spicy; which I found a bit odd. I tried the house hot sauce and Thai garlic hot sauce to spice it up. The Thai was good with it; but the house hot sauce again I found to be very sweet.  For my drink I tried their special Cherry Limeade; and once again found this very sweet; not tangy at all.  The dill pickle was great and I love that they sell the old 5 gallon pickle buckets to support their charity; and for $2 a bucket that is cheaper than the hardware stores!  I would say they make a good solid sub and I will be back to try some other subs in the future; and eat them fresh and warm next time. I'll also pick up a couple buckets!""",Pectv4bzzUVs0FQ6HQjW8g,"Firehouse subs...  If you have not tried it your missing out. \DELICIOUS\""  Food taste great; service is great; prices are great.

The bread was fresh and delicious!   Will be back!,#NAME?,Schlotsky's is a refreshingly original take on the sandwich. Unlike most of the other sandwich shops (Subway; Quiznos); Schlotsky's is both more delicious and much more expensive. It is also completely different. I recommend the Turkey & Guac.,#NAME?,I've been hearing about Carvel's Ice Cream on Yelp for a year or more so I decided to track one down in AZ as long as I'm here.  We found this one on the way back from the Public Pool near Hamilton High and stopped in to see what the buzz was about.  I cannot speak for Schlotzky's food; though it smelled good; but the Carvel's Ice Cream was fantastic.  Wonderful texture; smooth and creamy soft-serve; choices of Vanilla; Chocolate or a swirl of the two (all three of us got that) in just a cheap flat-bottom cone; a very nice snack for only a buck-fifty each.  Worth the stop.  PS  I checked my receipt the next day and I was charged $1.99 each for the cones.  I will have to look into that.  It's not the money; just the principle of being charged more than what the menu board posted.  I'm knocking off a star for that but will reinstate it if there was a misunderstanding on my part.,#NAME?,The girl behind the counter was nice.  The Cinnabon was not nearly as good as I expected.  Where was the carmelized sugar crunch and flavor? The yeasty goodness of a fresh cooked roll? The sugary crunch of the glazed icing on top?  All sadly lacking.  It was more like rolled up white bread with Karo syrup and cinnamon over and in it.  It didn't taste horrible.  It just wasn't wonderful; except for the candied pecans.  For the same price I could buy a whole bag of them.  I had a mini Cinnabon a few years ago and it was pretty good; albeit very sweet.  This one wasn't anything I'd go rushing back for.  Three stars for cleanliness; friendliness and the fact that they still serve Carvel ice cream even though it isn't advertised.  If I'd known this I would've been back sooner.  I haven't been here since they changed the sign from Carvel to Cinnabon a couple of years ago.,j-_jKQ-5IE4hqQzA-hsApw,"I'm a fan of Chick-fl-a.

I always get the turkey and provolone on wheat Mike's way (without tomatoes).  They slice their meats fresh and they are generous with the toppings; but sometime add too much oil...so keep that in mind.  I think Jersey Mike's has become my favorite fast sub sandwich chain. They may be a bit more pricey but they beat the snot out of Subway and Jimmy Johns when it comes to service and taste.  Happy Lunching!,78dfzUUVUeFpcYKqvs_X1w,I consider Jersey Mike's one of the premium sub shops. They are on the higher end of the price scale but their quality is the reason for that. Their fixins and bread are always very fresh and they slice the meats & cheeses to order. The employees are always friendly and chatty. They have a loyalty card that lets you earn free sandwiches. They have a few TV's that always have the games on. Because of the pricing; I don't go here more than once a week because I can probably save $3 at Subway with a daily special. It is a treat that I usually reserve for the weekend but we look forward to it because we like their sandwiches.

The younger dark girl who made our sandwiches (I think she said her name was shawny or something) was super friendly and smiley and nice. I ordered a sandwich and asked for double meat; expecting it to cost anywhere between $1-3 (I used to work at subway). She told me it would cost extra; I said it's fine. Then the manager rang me up and it was $15!! I was shocked; she asked if I wanted my receipt and I said yes; and I noticed she charged me twice for double meat which alone totaled to $5. When I confronted her about it she denied it and then said they have an \extra meat\"" option AND a \""double meat\"" option; WHO KNEW?! Not only did they not mention it to me or inform me; ITS NOT EVEN WRITTEN ANYWHERE ON THEIR DAMN MENU.

I told her they need to explain that to customers because we don't have any way of knowing and she just gave me this rude sarcastic ass smile and said OKAY! Fucking ridiculous; I feel bad for the poor sweet girl that has to deal with that thing managing her. Never going back to this location again.  Ps - I also noticed ants all over the floor when I was done eating my sandwich""",78dfzUUVUeFpcYKqvs_X1w,Better than SUBWAY; not as good as FIREHOUSE. A little to pricey for what you get.,78dfzUUVUeFpcYKqvs_X1w,This location has all of the usual elements: the service is great; the ingredients are very fresh; and the offerings are simple and tasty.  Jersey Mike's bread is my favorite sandwich bread in town (must be the result of my Philly roots).  Getting it Mike's Way really makes for a great sandwich; too:  it's a fantastic combination of lettuce; tomato; onion; red wine vingear (the more; the better!); olive oil (I prefer just a splash); oregano and salt!   My husband and I usually split a Giant Veggie sandwich; which comes for two kinds of cheese and green peppers.  It's a pretty good deal (not priced like Subway; but doesn't taste like Subway; either).,78dfzUUVUeFpcYKqvs_X1w,"Jersey's Mike's makes a good premium sandwich that for the most part is better then the rest.  A few nights ago; I found myself at Capriotti's waiting over twenty minutes for my sandwich to be made right.  You can read that review; but it made me think about all the different Cheese Steaks sandwiches in the area.    There are no Geno's or Pat's nearby that could take their crown; but I've always found Jersey Mike's and Corleone's on Northsight have done a better job then most.  And; I really don't mean that as a back handed complement.  This afternoon; I stopped by and ordered a 8\ Big Kahuna Cheese Steak to see if my memory and/or my stomach was playing tricks on me.  And; for the most part; I would say that Jersey Mike's does a great job.  I paid $7.25 for the sandwich; and another $2.19 for chips and a drink.  The total came to $10.32; which is a full dollar cheaper then Capriotti's; and there I didn't get chips for my $11.53.    Now; granted their sub was 12\"" to Jersey Mike's 8\""; but Mike's was just as good!  Though admittedly I have a weakness for Capriotti's bread with their corn meal bottoms.  Not being from Philly and not wanting to tread on somebody else turf (and Cheese Whiz aside); but I'm going to give Jersey Mike's Four Stars to Capriotti's Three and half Stars.  Enjoy!  ***Don't forget to ask for the \""stamp card\""; so you can record your visit ***""",78dfzUUVUeFpcYKqvs_X1w,Over priced for just deli meat... alos took a long long long time to get food,9UrMG4cn2nfIQsJlH8e2PQ,Great prices for the food. Love the online ordering,9UrMG4cn2nfIQsJlH8e2PQ,Wow pei Wei used to be one of my favorite places to eat. Since then prices have gone up and quality has gone WAY down! My friend accurately described the food as tasting like soap. I literally couldn't finish my meal because it tasted gross and I wasn't totally sure the chicken was thoroughly cooked. On top of that the staff is very depressing and unfriendly. Can't wait for this place to close and be replaced with a good restaurant.,9UrMG4cn2nfIQsJlH8e2PQ,I love the chicken fried rice here.  I always get a kick out of the soda machine; every flavor you've ever imagine and who doesn't like to try your luck at a fortune cookie again and again.  Great food at good prices. Fast services.,9UrMG4cn2nfIQsJlH8e2PQ,Pei Wei is not your typical Chinese restaurant; in fact; they view and market themselves as a Asian Bistro.  So depending on your tastes; you will either enjoy their version of your favorite dish; or not.  We came here last night and ordered a bunch of our favorite dishes and left feeling that there was a new choice in the Northsight corridor.   The area; for those not familiar with the Raintree exit from 101; is a mixture of Kohls; Walmart; Costco; Whole Food; et cetera; along with some quick food options like NYPD; Paradise Bakery; Al's Beef; Luke's; Asian Island and more.  We came around five-forty or so; and found the seating area full; but with some openings.  Two couples were ahead of us in line; but they had three cashier stations taking orders; so our wait was short.  The three of us ordered; a bowl of the Hot & Sour soup for $4.95; six Pork Egg Rolls for $7.25 to share; a Spicy Korean (Chicken) with noodles for $8.25; Mongolian Chicken with rice for $8.25 and a soft drink for $1.85.  The damage came to $30.55; plus tax.  Now; I've eaten Asian food all over the world and I've never had a Spicy Korean (see photo) before last night. I know my Korean friends and relations would not recognize it as Korean. There is no Bulgogie or Kimchi served at Pei Wei; though the noodles might remind you of Kalgooksoo.  But; the dish was good.  Four star good; as the review indicates.  The Mongolian dish (see photo) is similar to the Garlic and Scallions dish you would find in most Szechuan restaurants.  It's as good as any we've had before.   The Hot and Sour soup is also a winner and is easily recognizable. What  does  Pei Wei not serve?  Well; General Tao's chicken; pan fried dumplings; the afore mentioned Korean dishes; dim sun; and Pho of any kind.  I could go on.  The food is good; if you look past the name and accept the general Asian-ness of what is being offered.   One shout-out to Adrian; who acted as the dinning room Server/Clearer. He was great and very responsive in getting additional items for us!  Enjoy!,9UrMG4cn2nfIQsJlH8e2PQ,I really enjoyed Pei Wei. It is owned by the same ppl who own P.F.Changs- just not as pricey. I got a honey chicken dish and white rice. It was great! Can't wait to go back.,9UrMG4cn2nfIQsJlH8e2PQ,I like to eat here every now and then. The Mongolian beef is one of my favorites. Prices are reasonable.,PSIoHJpLPnkoH78iYRk6vQ,The prices are going through the roof and the choices are going down; not a great combination.     My Barbocoa burrito was $7.70....and guacamole of course is still not included. The next time they raise prices I will be heading for the hills. The meat was pretty good though and the burrito was still pretty big; but now it is getting big priced too. They also only offer one type of cheese now.       Ok; well to compensate for them raising prices; I now take a healthy handful of napkins and silverware home with me - it works out well for both parties.,5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,I have been to Portillos twice now; and the service and food are incredible.  The prices are pretty good too.  I can't wait for the Tempe location to open.,5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,"Pretty great food. It's really just popular for being the chain it is. It's a little chaotic and always full; but it's a great experience. I've tried quite a few of the items and been here multiple times; so here are my reviews for them. Chili cheese hotdog: Great! Chock full of cheese; chili; and onions. The hotdogs are great quality and the buns are soft; and delicious. Make sure to get the jumbo size! Definitley a lot bigger; but not too much more expensive.  Regular Hotdog: Just okay. I guess I'm not fans of any chicago dogs; but on the bright side; the thing was very full!  Italian Beef: MMMM!! What can I even say? The first bite was a little weird; but as I kept eating; it got more and more amazing!! The beef is perfectly cooked; and almost buttery tasting; and has a little kick of heat. THe flavor is seriously amazing; and bread compliments it perfectly. And for those who complain it's soggy; it's dipped in the juices! If you don't like it; ask for it \Dry\""   Cheese Fries: The fries are quite generic; but they're cooked perfectly crispy; and the inside is very soft. The cheese; as always; is great.  Burgers: They're pretty great. But why would you order a burger at Portillos? Good; but not recommended unless you're not a fan of anything else here.  Chopped Salad: Pretty good. But still; not worth it.  It has a very unique flavor and a nice sweet tang. Probably not worth getting again.  Chocolate cake shake: Just okay; great for chocolate lovers; but too sweet in my taste.  Overall; if you're a hotdog fan and looking for a great hotdog in the valley; this is defintley recommended. I also recommend the italian beef. One thing about this place is that it can add up to be a bit pricey if you order a few things.""",5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,"Pretty great food.

The quality is consistently high; servings plentiful and reasonably priced. Don't be afraid of a long line they move it through with amazing efficiency.  The Italian Beef; sweet with extra gravy is my go to. I've heard that the salads are great but that just seems wrong to this Chicago girl.  Oh and the chocolate cake - not too sweet; creamy frosting - yummmmmm,5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,This place is overhyped.  The food is ok; the portions a bit small for the price.  It's not the Oregano's of hot dogs like most of the reviews would lead you to believe.,5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,"Like many other misplaced Chicagoland natives who somehow settled in the valley; the little things are what I miss the most.  One of those little things are the amazing hot dog and italian beef restaurants all over the city and its sprawling suburbs.  Portillo's not only was one of my favorite of those places; but it was the one that my brother and I would ride our bikes over to so we could get a cheap and delicious lunch before hitting up a movie on a random summer afternoon.  With that kind of nostalgic expectations; Portillo's in Scottsdale had a lot to live up to; and guess what?  They hit the mark with a perfect bullseye.  A jumbo hot dog with everything on it (like a good Chicago place even an Arizona Portillo's knows that means no ketchup unless specifically requested); fries; and a piece of chocolate cake!  The 10 year old me; who ate this meal more times than I can even try to remember; couldn't have been any happier.  The dog is pretty much what I remember loving as a kid.  The bun was a lot soggier than it should be; which resulted in the very fresh condiments falling out; but I can forgive that.  The fries were the perfectly crispy \crinkly\"" fries that the best places always served.  The cake was perfectly moist and scrumptious with the very sweet [and unnecessarily too much] frosting that I couldn't get enough of as a child.  My fianc_ had the italian beef.  Awesome.  Make sure to order it dipped.  Messy but flavorful.  She also ordered cheese fries (they just give you a container of some cheese sauce that I couldn't stop dipping my fries into).  By the way; the food is cheap!  All that and two soft drinks was only a little more than $20.00.  The line out the door was expected; and even a little daunting; at 6:30 on the Friday night following the grand opening.  The good news; It moved fast.  We got our food and found a table in a little over a half hour.  If that can be done in the first week; then the pace will certainly speed up when the excitement starts to ware down.  If you're not already a Portillo's fan; you may want to wait a few weeks for the hype to die down before you give the place a try.  It's not like there was a shortage of Chicago hot dog and italian beef places around the valley.  But Portillo's is certainly a top notch addition.""",5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Having grown up in Chicago; I have very fond memories of Portillo's. Perhaps Portillo's changed since branching out or perhaps my memory distorts the truth. Going to Portillo's in Scottsdale was like watching the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles as an adult--I don't know what I ever saw in this.  To begin; I visited twice: once during peak hours and once in between the lunch and dinner rush. During peak hours; the wait was long; I was scolded for taking a picture inside; the order was incorrect; and the burgers were similar in quality to Wendy's. The second visit wasn't much better. I entered the drive through to see more attendants than cars and waited 15 minutes for a cheeseburger with only one car ahead of me. Upon arriving home; the fries were only half full; the soda was mostly ice; and the burger was a soggy mess of mayo and ketchup. I took three bites of the burger and tossed it in the trash.  The food doesn't live up to the hype or the price. I will not be returning.,5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,"My buddy Dave G. recently wrote an updated review on Portillos.  There are like a gazillion transplants from Chicago out here in AZ; so they have 2 of them.  After reading his review; it made me realize that the last time I was there (Buena Park); I left a bit disappointed.  I wanted to go see a movie that was close by; so I decided to stop and get some lunch.  Redemption?  Yes!  I got there early at like 10:40am.  There were maybe 5 other people in the joint.  I walked up and placed my order for a Jumbo Dog with mustard; onions and relish; a Maxwell Street Polish; a Large Cheese Fries; and a Large Diet Coke.  My total was just under $12.00.  Not the cheapest lunch; but it was substantial and kept me full most of the day.  I paid the lady my money and then took a seat.  A few minutes later; they called my number and I picked up my order.  Here is how everything tasted...............  Jumbo Hot Dog-  Delicious!  I didn't go full Chicago style on this one.  I'm not the biggest fan of tons of toppings.  Mustard; onion and sometimes relish and I am a happy man.  This dog was great!  It was large; plump and beefy!  It was encased in a soft; steamed poppyseed bun and then topped with mustard; onions and plenty of neon green relish.  I really liked the dog and for the .34 cents more than a regular dog; it is well worth going with the jumbo.  Pretty much a must order every time here.  Maxwell Street Polish-  The last time I had this I was extremely disappointed.  The onions were too watery; the bun was soggy and the sausage didn't taste that great.  This time around it was better than last time; but not as good as it could have been. The caramelized onions they use are plentiful; but they destroy the bun.  They soften it up too fast.  The Polish sausage itself was a bit lacking too.  It wasn't that flavorful and had a weird texture.  They skimped on the mustard too.  I ate the whole thing and it wasn't \bad\"" per say; but give me a Teds Polish any day of the week over this thing.  I doubt I will order it again.  I would get 2 Jumbo Dogs instead.  Large Cheese Fries-  These are probably my favorite thing here!  Whatever it is; their cheese sauce is just fantastic.  Its piping hot; creamy and it sticks to the fries perfectly.  They use a crinkle cut fry here and they are fried and salted nicely.  A quick dunk in the molten cheese and you have yourself a winner.  Their fries are in the same pricing scheme as their dogs.  A small fry is only like .20 cents less than a large.  Why even get a small?  For .20; you get way more fries.  The cashier was friendly and the guy that gave me my food was cheery.  They still aren't my favorite hot dog in AZ (Teds holds a special place in my heart); but a jumbo dog and some cheese fries are a guaranteed winner!  This visit redeemed my faith in Portillos and I'm sure I will be back soon enough!   Thanks for planting the seed; Dave G ;-)""",5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Whipped in here for lunch today; joined by Ursula D.; Marvin A.; Georgie M. and Mike C.  Arriving at 11 AM; the place was already packed.  Here was the long and short of this hot dog place for me:  After waiting a little while in line to order (ok); I went with an Italian Beef Sandwich (fully dipped) and a Jumbo Hot Dog with everything; char-grilled.  Up at the register; girl advised me that it would take seven minutes for my order to come up if I wanted my hot dog char-grilled.  (Ok.)  THE NOT-SO-GOOD:  ABOUT HALF AN HOUR LATER my order was ready; and a lot of this time was spent standing right at the pickup counter; as there was not way in hell to hear your number called in this EXTREMELY NOISY restaurant.  It was the loudest place I have ever been in my life except near a stage with a loud band playing.  It was hard to converse with my friends at the table and ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE to talk to the staff members at the pickup counter; much less hear them call your number over the PA system!  So it's ONE STAR & we're out of here; right?  Well; almost!     :-O  THINGS GET BETTER:    Finally the order came up and Manager lady apologized to me for the long wait (I could tell what she was doing by body language; not voice) & she handed me a big piece of complimentary Chocolate Cake to go with my order.  That was nice; & we're up to TWO STARS.     :-|  Back over at the table; I picked up my Italian Beef & took a big bite.  WOW; it was terrific!  To make a long story short; so was the hot dog (& later the cake).  YUM!  THREE STARS!     :-)  Lastly; the value was excellent (without counting the free cake).  The Italian Beef Sandwich was priced well at $5.25 and so was the Jumbo Hot Dog at $2.99.  Lots of other interesting things on the menu to try at a future date; too.  Up now to FOUR STARS!     :-)  SO; I can't give this place 5 Stars this time because of the very long wait to order & receive the food; plus the extreme loudness; but there was nothing negative to say about the food here.  What I had was all just great; & there are enough other tempting treats on the menu to keep someone coming back for a long time without getting tired of the place.  Next time I'll arrive at opening time of 10:30 (the same as you have to do at In-N-Out) & that just might get them up to 5 Stars.  The food certainly did IT'S part today!     :-)),5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,"Had a great visit to this placed today; joined by Jackie R.; Georgie M.; Robyn N. & Mike C.

Even though the restaurant was busy; there were two lines with an employee at each line taking orders. We were overwhelmed at how fast we made it to the front of the line. My wife and I ordered a Hot Dog (Chicago Style) each; split an Italian Beef sandwich with sweet pickles and I ordered a large milkshake.  NOTE: They ask if you want sweet or hot peppers which implies that it comes with it; but it's 50 cents more. So if you don't want any peppers; tell them 'NONE'.  We paid for our meal and was given a receipt with our order number on it. In ten minutes; they called our order. Opening the Italian Beef sandwich was messy and greasy with so-so flavor. My wife's hot dog was also greasy but my hot dog wasn't. The 'dogs' where okay; but I'm going to try Sonic's foot long Chicago dog to see if there is any difference.

It was dripping all the way through the paper and made the French bread very soggy. The meat does taste good but it was still too plain for me; despite how it was drenched in oil. French fries were too salty. I do like the poppyseed salad though. And the poppyseed muffin that came with the salad was good. I guess if you're like me and you don't like fast food; you probably wouldn't like this place. It's way too unhealthy. It's cheap; but I could think of many fast good chains that are cheap AND good.,5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Have you ever been to a small food-shop owned by an immigrant of any nationality where they seem to be skimping on everything to make ends meet? Common; we have all been to those places. You ask for an extra side of their delicious ethnic sauce and they want those two quarters in your pocket. They charge for the three day old iced tea. I understand for they are a small establishment. Portillo's is a big Corporate operation.   Well; cheap owner of Portillo's; can you put in a self-serve beverage refill counter? I do not want to have to go awkwardly across the pick up line to get another beverage. This is Arizona. We expect free refills with 105 degree weather.    At least you replaced uncle Sam's. That clown didn't even have blue cheese for his wings.    Oh yes; this is what happens when you skimp on beverage service in Arizona. In my dehydrated state I am not getting to the food until the middle of the review. The Italian Beef was excellent but small. I would like a 8 - 10 inch option for a couple extra bucks. The gardinere * lasted a few bites into the sandwich. Again; is there a guy fresh off the 747 skimping on food cost involved with  the operation?   Yes. I will return to Portillo's because it is good and well priced. I will pay extra for a couple of extra inches on a sandwich. In fact; I am back at the office now and still hungry. Maybe I will return for that delicious Italian Beef.   Oh yes; the employees were excellent at executing efficient counter service during a peak hour.,5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Have you ever been to a small food-shop owned by an immigrant of any nationality where they seem to be skimping on everything to make ends meet?

The italalian beefs are juicy and quite full. The hotdogs have a traditional Chicago taste. I went to the pre-grande opening; so the burgers weren't available. But if they continue being as authentic as the Chicago based locations; they'll be giving Ted's Hotdogs a run for their money! Technically it's considered cheap for a single item; but your average meal is about $13.,5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,OK; so after 2 tries; I'm giving this a 2 star review; which is a bit negative. Place is colorful as all get-out; and fun; loud; and kind of exciting first time you visit. After the 2nd time though; I think it's a tad overpriced for all the fanfare. And; yet we have another fast food joint; made to be a restaurant; where you have to pick up your own food.   Note to all restauarnt owners... If I want to pay high prices for food; bring it to me! I don't want to stand in line; I don't want to wait for my name to be called; just bring the damn thing to my table. Hell... Even Carl's Jr. brings your order to where I am sitting. I'm not lazy. It's just stupid to pay restaurant prices for fast food; in a sense. It's not that often I crave a chili dog. But I can grab a can of Hormel's chili for a buck; and package of hot dogs for 2 bucks; and with cheese and inions; I can feed myself and 4 friends for about a buck each. What's the difference between my deal and this place? About Ten Frickin' Dollars I tell ya'. I can get a better hot dog at Costco; thank you very much. Won't be returning.  And all you people from Chicago... Always talking about your town... Selling out the Diamondback games when your beloved Cubs are in town... Welcome Chicago to the Desert; etc. etc. Why did ya'all leave; and why are you here; if it's such a gosh-darn great town?????????,5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,OK; so after 2 tries; I'm giving this a 2 star review; which is a bit negative.

We are so happy that they have a Portillo's in Scottsdale. Always crowded; but they are very organized and the lines move fast. Can't beat the prices either.,5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Hmmm... This review is probably one of the most difficult to write.   I live within 3 miles of this restaurant. I have driven past many times and always wondered what it was about.  when I saw the reviews on yelp I thought it was worth a try.  However I really don't understand why people would give this four stars. It's a cheap and not very good burger joint... With some hot dogs and want to be sausages.  I ordered it Thai and meet and sausage sandwich... And it was just a big soggy nasty mess. Not very appetizing and not very good at all.  The french fries are like you buy from the store frozen Oreda. They're not well cooked or well seasoned or unique at all.    The salad bar is a joke... It looks like a mess and not very good options or tasty offerings.  The hamburgers are plain and disgusting. Not much thought no uniqueness. It's not even as good as cooking at home.  The chocolate cake was disgusting.   People will review saying it's cheap and good... But it's not even cheap. You and up paying nearly 5 bucks for a hamburger and fries. Smash burger is far better for the same money.  I really have a hard time understanding what people see in this place.,5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Took out of town family to this place; and it was our first time eating there.  The prices were reasonable; and the food was great.  Had everything from salads; to burgers to dessert; and everything we tried was good.  Will definitely be back!,5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Not sure what all the low ratings are about.  If you are not from Chicago you won't understand.  Tasted great just like their Chicago locations.  Very consistent product and service.  I was visiting family in Peoria Az and they had a taste for Portillo's so we took the 1 hire ride.  Prices are fair; ultimate comfort food.   I ordered a beef sandwich and a charbroiled burger.  Don't forget to try the chocolate fudge cake.,5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,I actually go to Portillo's a couple of times a month but not because the food is so great; or the atmosphere; or even the price.  It's simply convenient -- close to home and you get your food quickly since you order at a register and then pick it up at the counter.  Ambiance is zero inside; and the outside patio features car fumes.  The roast beef sandwich is probably their best item.  The rest - average.  The fries; sweet potato fries; and onion rings are all just ok or maybe a bit less.  The hot dogs are fine; but try making them Sonora style and you might have something.  If you are passing buy and are hungry and are willing to spend about $10 for a sandwich and fries; Portillo's will do.,5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,I finally got a chance to check this fine place out with the wife. Wow it is still pretty busy with lots of families everywhere enjoying themselves and having a tasty treat at the same time. I even saw several groups giving each other hugs with excitement as they gathered up together.  Both inside and out are very clean and well decorated with style. It is fun just going around and looking at all the cool items hanging on the wall. This place is oiled like a well tuned machine. Simply walk up and order; pay; then step to the side and pick up your food. You can watch them diligently working in the kitchen to get the orders to perfection. Cool!  Had to get a Jumbo Dog Chicago Style which is basically what they call everything. Also tried out the Beef and Cheddar on a Croissant with Sweet Peppers. The wife ordered an Italian Beef with Sweet Peppers and a large side of Cheese Fries to share.  The food was really tasty and fresh. I particularly liked the Dog which was created perfectly and had a great flavor profile. The Beef and Cheddar was also very tasty but seemed to be a little skimpy on the beef. The basic Fries and Cheese was hypnotically good. Maybe I'm just a sucker for that kinda cheesy goodness. They also have Burgers; Chicken Sandwiches; Salads; plus a whole lot more.  Nice place and I would definitely go back again. Would like to see the foot traffic for the order line go around the outside of the dinning area instead of cutting right through the middle and creating a criss cross of confusion for those eating; trying to get a napkin; or a refill. Maybe hiring a Feng shui Master to give it an adjustment. Reversing the kitchen would be too expensive at this point. LOL!  Grab a menu or study it before hand. A lot of people have a list of what they want already. Just remember - Go Cubbies & Da Bears!,5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,I'm a Chicagoland native and couldn't wait for the arrival of Portillos to the desert. This place does a lot really well - Italian beef; sausage; burgers; chicken sandwich; salads; desserts and; of course; hot dogs. Great prices. Bottled water for 69 cents! Great atmosphere and outstanding service for a fast good joint. My only disappointment is that they didn't bring to Arizona the Barnelli's side of the restaurant. Two requests for Mr. Portillo - please bring Barnelli's and please; please build in the Northwest valley - Peoria; Arizona would be great in honor of its sister city in Illinois.,5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,WOW! The best beef sandwich these lips have ever tasted. I ordered a beef sandwhich w/ hot peppers; a hotdog w/ everything; & a chocolate cake shake. The prices are very reasonable & like others have said the employees busted *ss today. I will definatly be back w/ a bunch of friends. YUM.,5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,LOVE their hotdogs!!! I am new to Scottsdale and was staying in a hotel nearby.  A big hotdog fan; I thought I would try it.  I have been back 4 times now.  Their hotdogs are wonderful; WAY better than Costco!!!.  The decor is really cute; food is good; TONS of staff so you never have to wait long for anything.  Their milkshakes are also very good.  You can either sit inside; go through the drive through; or sit on a outside patio. Unfortunately they don't allow dogs on the patio though :(  Highly recommend if you are hotdog fan!!,5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Portillos...What took you so long??? Great food; great prices! My experience in the valley has been- if a restaurant says it is Chicago style- it never comes close to what you can actually get in Chicago. We FINALLY have a REAL Chicago place- an original. And nothing has been lost in translation! I was lucky enough to be there for the test runs; and couldn't resist battling the crowds when they opened yesterday. Their employees are awesome; the food was wonderful! They bake their own bread and cakes on site. Tip- In a hurry???? Check out their drive thru if you can't wait long- my chopped salad only took 10 minutes to pick up. Favorites- Italian beef with hot giardinaire; burgers; chicken sandwiches; amazing salads and ...best chocolate cake EVER!,5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,I finally made it out here today and I absolutely loved it.  The place was packed!!  O my goodness loads of people!!  The place is huge; with an enormous amount of signage and colorful d_cor.  Ton's of tables; and lots of people helping.  The lines here were long; but I didn't spend more then 15 minutes between the time I stood in line and got my food.  they have two lines here. One for ordering; one for food pickup.  They had all 4 registers open; with girls throughout the line taking your order and writing it down for you to make things go quicker.  Once I got to the register; things went fine.  They sent me over to the pickup line where you grab your drinks and food.  That was the longer line of the two; and you kind of stand around in this clustered area waiting for your number to be called.  Being that this place was packed; there was an enormous amount of people waiting; but it seemed to go by quickly.  I found a seat near the door; and the food was awesome!  I got the jumbo hot dog with relish; mustard and onions with a pickle on the side. Bun was tasty; and I loved it. Price point was right on; and I will gladly drive the few extra miles to go here in the future.  If you haven't gone to Portillo's; you must do so!! Tasty!!  They also have a drive thru here; so if you want to avoid the crowds; or are in a hurry; this is the way to go.  Outdoor seating is available; along with ample parking in a very busy shopping center. Place is visible from the road; but come early because the place is non stop busy!!,5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Chicago memories from a hot dog and Big Beef  Okay; that lead line sounds horrible; but it's accurate. My wife and I loved Portillo's when we lived in Chicago. Cheap; good eats and an authentic Chicago Dog.  My father-in-law spent decades loving the Italian Beef sandwiches.  Prices are very good for the amount of food.  Truth is there is a lot of hype associated with Portillo's coming to the Phoenix area from folks with Chicago roots.  It's a classic and old-time fave.  Food is yummy and authentic; but nothing remarkable compared to your places with innovative chefs.  Um; it's also not considered health food.  (Just FYI. :o))  The drive thru process may also throw people the first time.  I had forgotten how unusual it is-- order with a person who walks your car to the cashier person who then send you up to the food deliverers.    Regardless; I love that Portillos and Chicago Hamburger Co are here to fill the need for authentic Chi-town fare.,5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Chicago memories from a hot dog and Big Beef  Okay; that lead line sounds horrible; but it's accurate.

They offer a variety of food at a good price. I recommend the burgers; but also enjoy the salads and Italian beef.,5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Food was just ok.  Burgers and hot dogs are nothing to rave about.   Price ok.  Very clean and very friendly.,5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Oh.....My.....Goodness!!! Cheap and greasy and love in a bag.   We ordered ahead to-go (which was recommended by a coworker). When we got there - it was the busiest restuarant I've seen for lunch probably ever. And they were flipping tables quick. The line was fast and efficient.,5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,"Love the Italian beef sandwiches; but the preparation seems inconsistent. Sometimes it arrives moist; but last time I went it was downright soggy and dripping au jus (or whatever you'd call it).   Fries are always great and a piece of their chocolate cake pretty decent.   Great decor and large seating areas; both inside and out. The place looks great.   It's not cheap. Two Italian beefs; a large fries; soft drink; and plain hot dog and you're north of $20. Oh yeah; and they charge for hot/sweet peppers. And the staff isn't always \there\"" - e.g. wishing you a good day at 7 pm. :-/""",5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,"Ever want to know what people from Chicago look like when vacationing in Scottsdale? Well then head on over to Portillo's Hot Dogs and check'em out in all their glory.   Best hot dog you'll ever have; and it's only $3 for a jumbo. it's only the best if you get everything on it. If you're a plain hot dog eater; go to Costco. Their cheese fries are great; but only get them if you like the fake nacho cheese; cause that's what they put on them. I get my beef sandwich \dipped\"" in gravy; with mozzarella and sweet peppers. You might need a fork and knife; but it's worth it. Skip the chocolate cake shake. IMO; I don't know what the big fuss is over that thing.  Originally they had people from Chicago training the Scottsdale team on how to act like they are from Chicago. Unfortunately; they are (or at least; seem to be) all gone now; so you're left with teenagers trying to pretend like their from Chicago. It's both endearing and awkward.   The location is great and the play great music. A little nostalgia never hurt anyone. I wish they would allow dogs on the patio like Culver's across the street.""",5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,"Only adequate.    There are several better hot dogs in the valley.  See Ted's for a similar priced dog that will blow your mind; or The Main Ingredient Ale House for a top notch \fancy\"" dog.  The beef sandwich is fine; but it's not something to bring me back.  It's kind of fun having a sogged sandwich disintegrate in your mouth like bread thrown to ducks.  But it's also kind of like eating duck-grade bread.  The gravy/jus is flavorful but the meat isn't anything special.  Tender and well prepared but not much to it.  Compared to a good cheesesteak; the beef sandwich lacks character.   Poor onion rings.  Crunchy; yes; but they were all coating; no onion.  Good price to value ratio.  Neat restaurant interior; but it's a zoo.  Friendly staff; fast service at 8PM on a weeknight.""",5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Stopped in on a Saturday evening with a party of 8. We were lucky enough to hit it between the waves of people. Between everyone in our group; we had italian beef; hot dogs; cheeseburger; a salad; and chicken fingers for the kids. The general consensus- its good. Is it worth the drive from Gilbert? probably not. The prices are good; they move people through at a fast pace so even if the line seems long it moves pretty quickly. I think that there are other places out there who do hot dogs and italian beef just as well; its more the experience that makes Portillo's special.,5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Portillo's Hot Dogs looks like the love child between a 50's Diner and the Las Vegas Strip.  I don't even like hot dogs but the throngs of people flowing through the doors at noon piqued our curiosity. After some initial disorientation due to the over abundance of signage; we located a paper menu and were pleasantly surprised that most of the menu items were not hotdogs.   I ordered a broiled chicken sandwich and my husband  chose the Italian roast beef sandwich.  My sandwich was fabulous! The bun was super fresh and there was a moist real chicken breast with some lettuce and tomato on it. The Italian sandwich was loaded with meat which had been soaked in a flavourful au jus. The $5 prices seemed like a bargain for them.   The sides of fries and onion rings  were nothing special but the apple walnut chicken salad and the chocolate malt are on my list for our next visit.   Interestingly many of the employees seem to be a couple of generations older than your typical fast food kind of place and they are super friendly and efficient .,5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Very loud; and overwhelming environment.  Personally I found it rather stressful; I guess it depends on your tastes.  The food was reasonably priced and tasty.  A good place to take kids; since the noise would easily drown out any tantrums they might throw.  I guess that is a positive; right?,5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,After leaving an event that didn't fill me up tonight; the BF and I went to Portillo's since we hadn't tried it yet and were right there! Well.....the food was better than the place we left; but it was nothing special. I had a hot dog and was disappointed that they didn't use Vienna beef and that they did not have neon green relish....those two things are what make a Chicago style hotdog in my book. The BF enjoyed his cheeseburger; I thought it was pretty par as far as cheap cheeseburgers go. I definitely would not drive all the way out here to eat again; but I wouldn't refuse to eat here either; so I suppose it is ok.,5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,A friend and I ran a 5k last night so we decided to indulge in Portillo's for dinner. We made out way over and while it looked busy; there wasn't a long wait to order or pick up our food. I decided to try the beef n cheddar and fries and my friend had a chili dog. Our food was ready after not too long and we grabbed a table and dug in. Unfortunately; the fries and lemonade far outshone the sandwich. It looked and tasted as though it had been preprepared and was sitting in a warmer. It was warm; not hot; and there was little cheddar to be found. My friend was equally unimpressed with his hot dog. For the price though; it wasn't a total rip off. On our way out; I grabbed a chocolate cake shake and he got a strawberry shortcake. Those definitely redeemed our experience and I loved the shake.   Maybe they are experiencing a lack of quality control in the kitchen since opening up? I'll probably try the Tempe location once it opens up but I was less than impressed with my first time here.,5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Fell in love with the chocolate cake shake; the $2.50 hot dog (with amazing buns!!) And just about everything else you can get on the menu (except the way overpriced salads; but who goes to a hot dog place to get salads anyway; right?!),5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,"Hello to all my fellow Chicagoians and to one and all!  FINALLY ...... Portillios is here........ I warned AL'S ITALIAN BEEF  that once Portillos arrives people will see what a real CHICAGO ITALIAN BEEF tastes like....and hey AL'S....notice the price on the beef?   REASONABLE AND YUMMY!     So; PORTILLO'S has been open since TUESDAY (4 days ago) and it is MOBBED!  And for good reason.  Like everyone elses reviews.... it was the BOMB!  The beef was totally and competely DELISHHHHHHH!  Perfectly \wet\"" and and ample amount of beef and the sweet and hot peppers gave it that extra burst of flavor.  The hubby had a chili cheese dog which he enjoyed; but come on now....why do we really go to Portillo's?  It's for the beef and DEBRA'S wonderful; creamy; rich Chocolate Cake!  OMG.... The hubby thought I was crazy for talking so much about how great this cake was and after taking one bite of mine.... he quickly took possession and all that was left for me was the last bite....which was just as good as the first bite and even better than I remember it to be.  The lines were massive and I commend the entire staff for moving everything along quickly and efficently.  It was well worth the wait and I cant wait for the Tempe location to open.  GO.....TRY......It's a MUST!  Now you can try a REAL taste of Chicago!  Bon Appetite' and welcome Cubbies...to spring training""",5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,This place is amazing! The Chicago dogs are amazing; as is Italian beef. Nice; fast service; delicious food; and get this; it's cheaper than the takeout place next to my house! Bottled water is 69! Can you believe it! It's cheaper than most fast food places (and the food is a million times better too). Everybody should get to eat here. Oh; and just a quick tip; if you like strawberries; the strawberry shortcake is absolutely to die for.,5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,I gave into the hype and met some girlfriends at Portillo's the other night for dinner...  Perhaps I had high expectations from both the Yelp reviews I'd read prior and all of my Chicago friends raving about this institution that they grew up frequenting.    Unfortunately; I didn't realize that a few weeks after the grand opening; Portillo's would still be a zoo!  It's huge and lines weren't long; so I can't complain about that; there were just tons of people (both patrons and employees) everywhere you turned.  I didn't love the layout either...  I'm usually all about fast casual concepts and ordering at a window; but I hated that there are three different areas to pick up your food.  It varies depending on if you order salads; hot food; and/or dessert.  And you have to wait for your number to be called and then go pick it up from the appropriate window.  It's hard enough to hear your number being called and then it's tough because you have to leave your group to go get your food; hence; not a relaxing start to a meal...  Amongst my group of three; we had a hotdog; a chicken sandwich (the breaded one on the croissant); a bowl of chilli; a barbecue chicken salad; and two large fries (one with cheese and one without).  We also had a lemonade and several bottles of water.    I will say that prices are very reasonable; and the food was fine -- not amazing though.  I felt like it was a glorified fast food restaurant; nothing to make me rush back; although I am sure I'll eventually make my way back to try some of the other things on the menu.  (The other salads looked good and I hear great things about their desserts).  Again; I wasn't a fan of all of the chaos -- perhaps that will die down eventually?  There were a ton of staff; but none of them were super friendly or helpful.  Guests are supposed to clear their own tables - we learned that when we asked.    Portillo's doesn't offer a kids' menu (although considering the prices; that's fine); and no refills on drinks either.  I think if you go in with expectations for a higher end McDonald's; you'll be pleasantly surprised.,5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Dogs were good and priced well. I visited on a Monday around 1:30.,5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,I never been to a hot dog joint like this before!!!  And it's so cheap too!!  I love what they include on these all-beef hotdogs.  I'm salivating just thinking about this.,5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,"Well let me start by saying the location is more than a notion being located right of the Expressway and at the Corner of 90th and Shea. Traffic is going to a nightmare and getting out of there is going to be an even bigger nightmare especially on weekends...you can count on it. However with all of that being said it is definitely worth the trouble. This was the second opening day event I went to today (First being Krispy Kreme which I will review later) and I have to say the owners of this establishment  \NAILED IT\""....wohoooo. I don't miss many things about Chicago during the 10 years I stayed there....but Portillo's was definitely one of them. The chopped salad was in a word DELICIOUS and I was hoping it would be the same way here in AZ. After waiting for a year for this place to open I was not disappointed. The staff was awesome....the drive-thru was fully staffed and not a single person was waiting out there. The outdoor seating is a bit close to the entrance and right next to the drive thru lane so they might want to look into other options with that.  Back to the Chopped Salad.....as I said before just like in Chicago.....they NAILED IT. However the lady that was making them today seem to have trouble with special orders. I ordered 2 chopped salads one with no bacon.....and one with no cheese....she managed to mess that up REALLY. I didn't hold that against her or the establishment because it was opening day...but if it happens in the future they will lose a star on this review. The prices were also dead on and the establishment itself made me feel like I was in Chicago for at least a few minutes anyway. I think the people that moved here from Chicago like myself will be very pleased and for the newbies.....well I think their dining options will change once they visit Portillo's.  Warning....Warning....Warning....to Chili's......Applebee's .....Mimi's Cafe....Quiznos and Culver's......there is a new kid on the Block and it's name is PORTILLO'S....WATCH OUT....WOHOOOO. Eat; Drink; and be Merry my Friends!!!!!""",5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,I've heard about this place before.    I was shocked by a few things....  A.  They have a TON of employees running around.   B.  It was cheap; very cheap.  Like $2 for a hot dog cheap. C.  Even though A & B were true; it was still delicious.    I don't know how they make any money; but it was really good.  Their drive through line was very very long so we ate inside.  We got a Chicago dog; a chili dog; and chili-cheese fries.  Took about 10 minutes to get our food but it was worth the wait.,5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,Was excited about the hot dog experience considering the reviews however the hot dogs were below average. We ordered the signature original hot dog and it was not good; I much prefer the Costco hot dog hands down. The only reason I would even consider going back is because their onion rings were phenomenal. One of the best I've ever had. Chili fries were also decent. However considering they specialize in hot dogs; I think they are in no comparison to what I'm used to back home (Seattle).,5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,"I FINALLY stopped in to Portillo's on Friday for lunch with a Chicago native that moved to our Phoenix office. I had no idea what to expect other than knowing they took over the old spot that Uncle Sam's used to fill on 91st and Shea.   First off; I COULD NOT BELIEVE how busy it was; especially for a weekday lunch in an area without a large concentration of businesses (I work downtown). Drive through line was a mile long (but seemed to be moving quickly). When we got inside I was shocked at the amount of people cramed into this large space. Not a table to be found and long lines again; but we had made the drive so there was no turning back... Glad we didn't because that line moved quickly also.  My buddy and I both got the \combo\"" sandwich; which is an Italian Beef with a sausage stuck in there also. Strangly enough my Chicago friend got a chicken sandwich; which apparently he loves there.  Cool thing about the \""combo\""; or just regular beef sandwiches; is you can choose how much \""gravy\"" you want on them. Hardly any; some poured on top; or; and of course the one that I picked; DIPPED. They dip the who damn sandwich in the \""gravy\"" (beef drippings). NOW THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKIN BOUT.  We got cheese fries too. Fries were good but they put the cheese on the side...kind of a bummer; BUT the sandwiches were excellent... Best Italian Beef I've had other than Luke's of Chicago on Indian School; which is quite a compliment.  We did end up finding seats by the way. Very crowded place; but a lot of turnover; so if you just wait a second something will pop up.  Prices were excellent also. Most sandwiches were right around $5 bucks; even the Halibut fish sandwich; which I gotta try next...I'll be back. Gotta try the dogs too!!  Enjoy""",5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,"Cue Gershwin's \Rhapsody in Blue\""; because the curtain just went up yesterday on a new Five Star food experience!  For most Chicago food lovers; Portillo's holds a special place.  Yes; there are several hundred Italian Beef and Char Dog places up there.  But it was Dick Portillo and his family who first capitalized on turning Chicago comfort food into a culinary science.  Then they made it into a destination stop with all of the visual entertainment of their theme restaurants.  Very simply; the food was very good and it was a fun place to go.  This Portillo's is no different.  Here they have a 50s/60s Retro Theme.  As I waited in line last night; it was more like a carnival atmosphere.  Of the nearly four hundred ahead of me; there was ne're a raised voice or a sad face. Everyone was laughing and telling stories.    As you entered the restaurant after forty-five minutes to an hour outside; and then realizing you had another forty-five minute wait inside -- you looked around and saw nothing but a sea of happy; satisfied customers chowing down on their favorite food.  I was ordering for three; since I had two hungry somebodies waiting at home for my food delivery service.  For myself; I ordered the Big Italian Beef wet ($5.95) with sweet and hot peppers giardinera ($0.90) and Mozzarella ($0.50) and a Jumbo Hot dog ($2.99) with everything on it.  Boy; did if goof.  The prices for the food are outrageously fair and reasonable.  Heck; I left thinking they got my order wrong with all the food they gave me.   Their beef sandwich was nearly a foot long and I needed to cut it in half.  There was no way any human being could finish something this big and I didn't.  The amount of beef on half; was more than double what I have had in the past at any other restaurant! They could have easily sold my half sandwich for the $5.95 that I paid.  My jumbo dog was also very good; but I should have ordered it charred instead.  It was worth the wait; everything was delicious.  The other items on my family's order; were two Beef 'n Cheddar croissants for $5.25 each; another Jumbo Dog with an order of large Fries ($2.19) and onion rings ($2.09); along with four hot giardiners ($0.45) and one pop.  Our total came to $35.95; including taxes and could have easily fed four.  As I said; I goofed and over ordered by a mile!  Other items on the menu that we didn't try are: the 1/3 of pound Char Burgers for $3.95; or the double for $6.19. They also have a Halibut  or Tuna sandwich $5.19; and a Veggie Sandwich for $5.35. Portillo's is famous for their Garbage Salad which is $7.69.  They also have a Chicken Caesar for $6.59.  Their Shakes are $2.69/ $3.39 and Malts $2.79/ $3.59. For something completely different; they also have Tamales $1.89 and a Tamale in a Box for $2.99.  In Yelp-ese; a Four Star experience is \""Yay! I'm a fan.\""  A Five Star is \""Woohoo! As good as it gets!\""  Before tonight; I would have said Portillo's was a Four Stars. But NOT after this evening.  To even the toughest critic or curmudgeon; they would have to admiit that this is as good as it gets!  Five Stars.  Enjoy!""",5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,People from Chicago love this place! I am not from Chicago. I've tried a few things here since the restaurant opened. The Italian beef; imo; wasn't worth all the hype or wait. Hot dog was tasty; but how can you screw up a hot dog other than putting ketchup on it! This restaurant should be ashamed of itself for allowing their canned disgusting tamales to be served here; especially in AZ. Too crowded. Too pricey. Plenty of better restaurants in the area.,5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,I noticed that the Polish sausage is grilled and the Vienna dog is steamed or boiled resulting in no snap with the bite.  Toppings were great; sauted onions on the Polish (wow; great flavor due to carmelization) and good chili and melted cheeze on the dog.  Noon on a Monday; place packed but a few tables were available.  Staff gave us a menu and brief lecture about the place and the various foods; nice first time touch.  Prices were reasonable and the portions large.  The place was quite large but clean and friendly.  I will be back to try their halibut and fresh tuna sandwiches!!,5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,To be honest; the place isn't all it's cracked up to be; and for a few reasons.   1. Everyone here (and by everyone I mean the customers) are SO bitter! Probably because they have to wait in a 30 minute crowd standing shoulder to shoulder with strangers; but seriously. Everyone is so grumpy and has such an attitude! Normal people turn into vultures hunting and pecking for tables; a spot at the ketchup dispensers; or at the registers and do whatever it takes to get what they want; even at the expense of other diners. It makes the experience a little less pleasant.   2. The whole place seems to lack organization. Not that the restaurant is dirty or disheveled; but the way it is set up doesn't make sense; considering the high volume of people it gets. The line literally wraps around the dining area; and makes it virtually impossible for people to get inside the area where the tables are to find seating. Also; the restaurant is divided into sections. A salad area; a place to order your sandwiches; hot dogs; etc; and then a dessert area. Why can't you just order all at once without having to navigate through crowds of people?  3. The food is just okay. In our party; we ordered the Italian beef sandwich with roasted peppers and mozzarella; a hamburger; side of chicken tenders; cheese fries and regular fries. The sandwich was apparently decent. Not the best my boyfriend has had; but definitely not the worst. The hamburger was also good; but then again; they're not a hamburger joint; and how hard is it to mess up a hamburger. The chicken tenders were something like what you'd find at a Safeway deli. This doesn't mean that they were bad-- they were just average. Not to mention; one of the chicken tenders in the box (each box is a 4-piece) was about the size of a McDonald's chicken nugget; if not smaller. The one thing that caught me was the two orders of fries.. With the cheese fries; you get a normal order of fries with a cup of fake nacho cheese-esque sauce; that you're supposed to dip your fries in or whatever. I would have definitely preferred a cheese that was either melted on top or that had a bit more flavor. And the fries themselves; by looks and taste; were somewhat like the crinkle-cut fries that you'd find in the frozen food section of your local grocer.   Regardless; they still have a really cute atmosphere/decor: that of a 50's/60's Chicago-style diner; and their staff seems to know most of what they're doing. I would go back because their prices are great ($3.65 for a decent-sized burger); but it would be under the conditions that 1. the weather is nice because it's a 50/50 chance that you'll be sitting outside; and 2. that I have a solid hour; hour and a half to blow considering the line to order and the wait to get your food and then find a table.   Anyhow; to sum it up: not great; not terrible. Just average.,Me6hKl5pjH2KCuxLZm6pzQ,Great place for families. Toddler play area :) sadly a lot of older kids are in there  plowing past the toddlers & employees ignore it. Otherwise good prices & clean place.,Me6hKl5pjH2KCuxLZm6pzQ,Cleaner play area than McDonalds but smaller. But they also provide individual wipes next to the door. Milkshakes are thick and creamy. Inexpensive. Closed on Sundays; though.,Me6hKl5pjH2KCuxLZm6pzQ,Their food is good; and the sides are good.     Now; on to the big 3:  Price:  Pretty typical; and non-effective in correcting the high prices of fast food.  A single diner can expect to pay $8-11 to eat one meal.  I'm guessing that no energy is expended to correct the high prices of one dinner meal.  Service:  Everyone I've talked to has been pleasant; and smiling; if even on an only-superficial basis.  Taste:  The chicken items taste just like chicken.  It's everything you would expect.  Nothing fantastic.  In Summation:  They close as early as 9pm; and ALSO on every Sunday.,ivVVCPUm9mmU6K7xR41vEg,"Since January of 2014 I have; on three occasions; bought subs that ingredients have been omitted. Twice I have returned to the store and a new sub; with all the ingredient's I paid for; was made. It happened again last Tuesday March 18. I bough a \Giant #8 and the bacon and ham was missing. I realized this while on my way to Tucson and could not return to the store. This makes me wonder if leaving off ingredients to cut costs is a company policy. Three times is not a random mistake.""",ivVVCPUm9mmU6K7xR41vEg,I obviously love myself a sandwich; there is no denying that.  This is probably the place i frequent the most often.  You really cant beat fresh cut meats.  I get it Mikes way less the onions (they seem to over power most sandwiches) - lettuce; tomatoes; oil; vinegar; spices then add yellow peppers.  Yum.  Great; now I'm hungry.  Bread is a bit crunchy; I usually like a softer bread but I think the oil and vinegar need a bread that can stand up to it.  No biggie.  A bit pricey; but worth it.,ivVVCPUm9mmU6K7xR41vEg,We could tell this was a new place as soon as we walked in the door. There were only a few customers and the restaurant was spotless. Overstaffed by about three people and all were very energetic and very welcoming. We ordered our food and sat down to wait. A few minutes later they called our name and we grabbed our food. My Buffalo Chicken Wrap was really good; at least to those of us that like wing sauce and blue cheese dressing. Yum! I also appreciated the fact that they offered a wheat tortilla and I didn't have to ask. My BF got a Chipotle Cheesesteak and said it was pretty good too. The prices were reasonable. This could be a good place if they can keep up the momentum. I will surely be going back to give it another try.,ivVVCPUm9mmU6K7xR41vEg,I loved 'em when I lived in Jersey and I love 'em here in Arizona!  Friendly; capable; conscientious crew at this location; as well as the ASU/Rural Rd. location.  Some people will have a problem with their bread but I've always preferred it to any of the other sub places around.  LOVE the Big Kahuna Cheesesteak (ask for them to make it with chicken to save on fat/calories) and I love the refillable Breast Cancer Cup; which makes it a bit more affordable. Also; coupons are everywhere nowadays so even though they are a bit pricier than other places; with a coupon it's a bit closer to their prices--yet SO much tastier!,ivVVCPUm9mmU6K7xR41vEg,Fast; friendly and frank.  I work in the same area; walking distant; and I visit at least once or twice a week. Kinda $$ for the size; but still good. I am starting at #1 and going down the list....skipping the 14 because..its all veggie and a complete waste of money for the price it is at. I'll update once I am done. I am in no rush so it will be a while. So far I am at 4 and i cant say I would buy any of those again.  R\\_   NOte: Lunch is busy with a line of 8 or 10. So be ready for that.,ivVVCPUm9mmU6K7xR41vEg,FYI: This is NOT your avg fast food sub!!! Jersey Mike's blows Subway out of the water. For what it is (a fast food sandwich joint) it hits all the marks. The bread; the meats; and the veggies are all unbelievably fresh. The staff is very friendly; and the prices are right.   Overall; if you're looking for a quick place to grab a sub; Jersey Mike's is the way to go.,EzwpoKQrHgDHwpuCUw074Q,Decided to come here for lunch today...back on the low carb kick so I went with some lettuce wrapped Double Doubles.  They really do hook up the lettuce here in the lettuce wrap.  These burgers had like 6 extra lettuce leaves wrapped around them.  I just discarded them to the side and chowed down.  The burgers were great as always.  Hot; fresh; inexpensive and delicious.  Service was friendly although a little weird.  The girl at the register wouldn't really look me in the face.  She kept peering over my shoulder like she was talking with the person behind me (even though there was nobody behind me).  Can she see ghosts?  Fucking rad if she can!  It wasn't a lazy eye either.  It was just a bit odd.  At least she got my semi unorthodox order correct the first time (lettuce wrap; no tomato; no spread; both kinds of onions).  This place is 1 mile from work so I'm sure I will be back.  Can't really beat In N Out!,EzwpoKQrHgDHwpuCUw074Q,"Mmm..I LOVE me some In-N-Out! Yes; the menu is small; but the burgers are huge and the prices are a steal. I can walk out with a double-double cheeseburger; animal; protein style (don't judge; I'm pregnant!) for less than $3.50...and I won't even finish it.   I'm stoked they changed their 'cash only' policy...as that was always a pain in the ass. They also use fresh ingredients; never frozen beef; and they cut their own fries.   I don't eat fast food; and I would highly disagree that In-N-Out be classified as typical \fast food\"". Do you see Burger King or McD's using only the freshest ingredients and cooking everything to order?""",EzwpoKQrHgDHwpuCUw074Q,Did I miss something or what? My son brought me here for a late lunch after a Dbacks game. Passed on Chinese which I regret now. We purchased 2 doubles; a single; 3 FF's animal style and 2 large drinks to go. Total...$23 and change! I got the single thinking it would be enough for me. My mouth was watering thinking about a nice thick juicy burger. Wrong! The only thing juicy was the lettuce and tomatoes. I opened the burger to discover a 3 1/2 inch diameter; thin wafer of meat; dry as a bone. Some parts I could actually see through. It was thinner than McD's. 1/8th pounder? I couldn't even taste it. I think you need to order the triple to taste the meat. By the time we got home (5 min.) the cheese on the FF's congealed into one big glob. I ate it cause I was still hungry after the burger. I ate it like a potato pancake. It was unappealing but tasted OK. My son liked his meal?  I would go to BK's; McD's or Pete's any day of the week at 1/3 the price. Sorry son!,EzwpoKQrHgDHwpuCUw074Q,Not much to say but yum. Quality was great. My burger was fresh and hot and the fries are always awesome. We don't have one in Hawaii; so I always try to stop at an Inn n out while on the mainland.  I prefer everything plain and untainted by the animal style that everyone loves so much.  Cheap; fast; and good; nuff said.,EzwpoKQrHgDHwpuCUw074Q,My 21 year old grandson who lives with my wife & I along with My 14 year old grandson who spent the night while my wife is in the hospital for a knee replacement. After leaving the hospital around 7pm we stopped at In-N-Out Burger for a quick dinner. I normally detest fast food; but I don't even think In-N-Out truly belongs in that category.  A lot of people would say In-N-Out is overrated but they are good. They have a very limited menu of get a load of this; all they have is burgers; fries and a few beverages to wash them down.    FOOD: Cooked fresh; our burgers came out hot. They weren't sitting under a heat lamp like some places. It's fast food that's WAY better than any other options out there. For a fast food burger the flavor can't be beat. FYI: I'm NOT a fan of their fries. PRICE: reasonable price. SERVICE: The service was fast and they were really nice. CONCLUSION: I don't know what the secret  is.  Chances are you can make a better burger at home; but at the same time there is just something about In-N-Out burgers that makes them  delicious. Everything was cooked to perfection! This In N Out is on it! They're at the top of their game to handle soooooooooooo many people and still produce such top notch food!,EzwpoKQrHgDHwpuCUw074Q,Overall - 3 stars...burgers are okay - fries are fresh cut and pretty good.....  Two words - ANIMAL STYLE!! Now that's a burger! 5-Stars for the animal style double double!! that's the only burger I will order here!   Everything else is good to fair for the price...,EzwpoKQrHgDHwpuCUw074Q,i think this place is really overrated. the menu is extremely limited and small. it has to be the smallest menu of any fast food place. the food is fairly boring. their buger tastes very similar to a whopper but is much smaller. prices are a little high for what you get. just ok place.,5qElnvC0danGy0io0-NRKw,YUM!!!!  This is by FAR one of our families FAVORITE Chipotle stores.  The food here is always awesome and super fresh.  Now; I know everyone knows the food is spectacular and fresh; but what they may not realize is how great and friendly the staff is; especially Casey who helped us out this last time we were in.   Also; I have to admit that I hate waiting in line (since who can resist this place) so we always order online; drive to the store and walk straight to the counter and never have to wait.  Nothing better than an inexpensive; high quality meal with no clean up!  Thanks!,5qElnvC0danGy0io0-NRKw,So I read the reviews and as usual I don't pay too much attention to them because I like to make my own judgment on a place based on my experience so with that said I went in to the restaurant at 9:40 pm which is 20 minutes till close but they had over 12 employees working at what seemed full throttle which is typical for young folks trying to get off and out on a Friday night. I have to add that Chipotle is one of my favorite places to get food and having children and bills it's almost a treat to have being that for only me and my girlfriend it was 21 dollars. I got to the restaurant and there was a line. Usually a line for Chipotle but always moves fast I ordered 2 burritos; chicken for my girl and steak for me so as he was making my burrito I asked for half barbocoa and half steak he asked if I wanted double meat or just half and half and I said half and half. Well the barbocoa pan was full of meat so he gave me a tong full and the steak pan had less than a big spoon full literally 5 little pieces of steak and rather than get something fresh from what they were cooking behind him he passed my burrito off to the next stage of the burrito making phase and as i stood there looking at the 2 burritos with the meat on the rice my girls burrito had almost triple the meat mine had so rather than be a jerk and make a complaint I just asked for double meat which the guy from the next phase of the burrito making he grabbed a heaping cup full of meat. The little cups they usually put the salsa or other sides in and it was what the amount was for being a single meat burrito I asked him to go light on the hot salsa because let's face it that stuff can melt the paint off of a car if you tried. Lol but the guy put a whole ladle full. I just shook my head to which he didn't notice and started wrapping my burrito after placing the other ingredients I asked for in it. So final stage of the transaction of the burrito making production line the cash register guy asked if I wanted some chips or anything else. I love the lime salted chips and of course said yes. I didn't notice the size of the chips till I got home and to a great disappointment the chips were hardly filled to the bottom of the letters of the bag where it says Chipotle.  Which you get more if you buy a 1.49 bag from the store. So very disappointing and to have payed 21 dollars for food that was poorly put together and skimped on for chips and meat  which I had to pay double just to get what I should have gotten for the single meat price mind you; also the non existing bag of chip's. I will make sure they never get my hard earned money ever again. How could such an amazing chain become so non amazing over the last few years? For me I know that I won't be going back to this location or any of their locations which is terrible because of this experience and I truly hope my review reaches out and makes someone think twice before they go overpaying for poor food and poor service at Chipotle. Smh,5qElnvC0danGy0io0-NRKw,I have been here a few times; no complaints. But today; the line was almost out the door for lunch. They had 6 people working the front counter to insure each step was done in a timely fashion. It was quicker than a fast food drive through and my chicken burrito bowl is delicious! I love that Chipotle is an inexpensive option for a healthy meal. Everyone there seemed to enjoy their job also. I will be returning for lunch again soon.,5qElnvC0danGy0io0-NRKw,I wish this wasn't the closest Chipotle to my house. Their biggest problem here is inconsistency. The portions are never the same; you have to keep repeating yourself.  Sometimes they give you a good scoop of rice; other times you can still clearly see the bottom of the bowl.   I always get a vegetarian salad; with the vegetarian options Guacamole is included. Countless times when I say I want guac they tell me it's $1.80. Instead of correcting I just say OK with the hopes the cashier is smarter than the salsa girl.   Countless times there hasn't been any hot sauces put out. None by the soda machine; none on any of the tables.   We try to avoid this location at all costs; unfortunately it's the closest one to home. I just wish they would train their staff better and be more consistent.,5qElnvC0danGy0io0-NRKw,"Ahh; Chipotle; a college kid's dream: cheap; copious amounts of Mexican food that is actually very good for being mass produced. You can get what you want; it's good for gluten intolerant people like me because I can get a few different things; and this Chipotle in particular is in a really convenient location; it's across the parking lot from a super target; and there's a self serve yogurt place nearby; so you can get dessert! YAY!   Alright; here's my \beef\"" with Chipotle.. HAHA! See what I did there? (I am so unfunny...) In my honest opinion; it's inconsistent. There have been times I've eaten there and my tacos or salad are perfect and I have a really good experience there. Then there are times where the rice wasn't salted correctly or something; I have no idea what happened; but all I know is when I took a bite of rice I immediately spit it out because it was so over salted. Really; it was crunchy because there was so much salt in it. Same goes for their proteins. I try to switch it up between barbacoa; chicken; and carnitas; and with each there has been at least one occurrence where it was way too salty and I couldn't eat it. Maybe I'm just being a the kind of customer that restaurants hate; but if a place has had multiple occasions where the food is so salty it can't be eaten; then they're going to start having some serious problems. My only other issue is there's one guy who works there who I think is trying to flirt with me; so he way overfills my tacos or salad with whatever protein I get. It's a tad suggestive; don't you think?   I'm not saying I hate Chipotle at all; in fact; I really like the concept that you can get whatever you want; at a good price; and you know that they're using quality ingredients. They're just really big fans of salt.""",5qElnvC0danGy0io0-NRKw,"Ahh; Chipotle; a college kid's dream: cheap; copious amounts of Mexican food that is actually very good for being mass produced.

Inexpensive; filling and reasonably healthy (if you skip the sour cream; cheese and taco shells haha).  I love a good burrito bowl!!!  If only this place wasn't right next to a Five Guys.  I feel like it's always Russian roulette about which one I'll pick haha.,lciZhyp_xwKNBOVyzxqhbg,Avoid at all costs unless you enjoy standing in line watching 4 people try to figure out how a burrito is made.  Slowest location I've ever seen; even when there's no line.  Never going back.,lciZhyp_xwKNBOVyzxqhbg,Wish I could give 0 stars. This is the slowest chipotle I've ever been to. Plus they skimp on everything. Avoid at all cost.,p9amH4v0zP1BQgJhYjeUMg,If you do not like Chipotle; you have some issues. Cheap; fresh and ethical! lol   It is amazing; what else can I say. They can have an off day here and there; but that only shows that it is made fresh and not from a package. Even on a bad day; it is still good. I love you Chipotle!!! om nom nom nom,p9amH4v0zP1BQgJhYjeUMg,Been coming to here about once a month for the past five years; great food for a reasonable price.my only complaint is that every once in a blue moon a new employee ruins my burrito by not rolling it properly.,p9amH4v0zP1BQgJhYjeUMg,It wasn't good this time. BOOOOOO! Anyways; boyfriend went to get me a chicken bowl while I stayed in the car because little man was asleep. When we got home; I opened up my chicken bowl. First thing I notice.. Um where the heck is my lettuce? I know it's nothing but still. Chipotle can be pricey! Anyways; while I was eating it. Ummm I found one uncooked chicken. Like come on guys that shouldn't even happen at all. I was just so disappointed in them. Usually there good but lately they been slacking. Next time I'll try a different location; because they been slacking for reals!,kIco4kv-FHT6QqdkDQ2cow,They server burgers for breakfast!  Full menu is available all day; which is a huge plus for me and anyone else who prefers a burger and fries over an egg muffin/bagel/croussant to start out the day.  I know that BK and JIB also do this; but these are superior burgers with fresh lettuce and tomatoes.  This place would rate 3 1/2 stars if that was an option.    I haven't tried the new hot dogs on the menu; but I have heard they are worth the price (a couple of bucks).,kIco4kv-FHT6QqdkDQ2cow,Ya know; it's Sonic.  They've some decent prices (wishing they had more dollar items myself; but hey....) and their food is often decent to good.  I can't see Sonic ever getting a 5 star review in the local magazines but for fast food; it's pretty good.    Just sorry they dont have carside service at this one.,kIco4kv-FHT6QqdkDQ2cow,Well i see no one mentioned this sonic is down the street from the Scottsdale 6 drive-in. I seen one the yelpers wrote that there are not many drive thru sonic's anymore...you are wrong there my friend. If you go down south...Arkansas; Louisiana; Texas; etc...you will find plenty of them. This is the only sonic in fact that i have seen made like this one...because this is a rare establishment...but that is what makes it so great. The red phones only exist here...and they fact they have no drive-in is totally wild...but cool as well.   The menu is full of you classic sonic goodies from the burgers and fries....to the slushes and limeades. The desserts are also the same as are the great tots and footlongs...but the true gem of this place is the indoor seating area once again with the red phones..i simply loved the place. Not to mention once again you can buy your food here for cheap and then take it down to the drive-in movie and your all set for the night...check out the pics this place is a must see. Eat; Drink; and be Merry my friends!!!!,ZDXZGMpA4IhIqmMIMdeHlA,Fat Burger is one of those places I always go to when I'm in town.  They have awesome burgers and fries that are made right in front of you; Subway-style.  Prices are about right for a whole meal; and since they're located near ASU; there's plenty ofcollege flavor to go around here.  Their menu is basic; but I would say that Fat Burger is comparable to Seattle's Dick's.  Yum!,ZDXZGMpA4IhIqmMIMdeHlA,We went in here tonight. We weren't really hungry so we were gunna split a burger. We ordered the baby burger and it was incredibly small. We had to go buy another. Its overpriced in my opinion. The fries were alright. I like crispy fries so I was disappointed. The burgers were good but they better have been for what we paid for them. My wallet is still angry with me.,ZDXZGMpA4IhIqmMIMdeHlA,Pfft. If I wanted to pay for overpriced burgers and fries; I'd go gourmet. Instead; I'll drive down the street to In-n-Out for something worthwhile.  Only drunk college students head here late at night.,ZDXZGMpA4IhIqmMIMdeHlA,Methinks not... but the employees were awesome and they do serve $1 PBRs.   Mill is not known for having great food options and Fatburger lives up to that reputation. The burger patty was very surprising thin. This chain must have gone down hill pretty fast after their rapid expansion. The prices are a little much for what you get. I would at least expect the bun and other ingredients to have been fresh; but I was disappointed.  Try eating elsewhere!,ZDXZGMpA4IhIqmMIMdeHlA,I find this place a little expensive. . I wasn't really a big fan of this place. Food to me was just ok; nothing special. There is 3 different burger sizes and I don't think the medium burger size example was true in size. My burger was way bigger. I would get the small next time.,ZDXZGMpA4IhIqmMIMdeHlA,As far as burgers go; this is my absolute favorite place to go. I love the fact that the burgers are made fresh and ginormous! Then order the fat fries (or you can choose shoestring or curly) and you are eating in true American fashion. Don't worry if you don't eat beef they do offer a turkey burger that will keep you coming back. The shakes are an amazing must have and not to mention beer as well. You will leave this placed stuffed for about $11 per person that's including drink; so if you want to go cheap; tasty and all American; go to Fat Burger their amazing,byFWmwlVSmUj-AmM6NZYvw,These burgers are fantastic - made fresh; good ingredients and very tasty. Their prices are very reasonable too. Fries are hand cut and very good too. Would eat here more often if it was closer to home. Favorite place for a simple burger lunch.,byFWmwlVSmUj-AmM6NZYvw,"In n Out has never disappointed me (after I found out about \fries well done\"" that is...). For those who just don't understand the hype; it's very simple. Fresh; high quality ingredients. Doesn't taste frozen because it isn't (even the buns; cheese and veggies taste much better than other cheap eating options). The service is outstanding; probably because they pay more than other fast food joints. Now; I will say that the food is very good taken home or back to the office; but to truly experience it's greatness; it should be eaten immediately at the restaurant or in your car in the parking lot (so the toasted bun and everything else is crisp vs. soggy). It really makes a huge difference!""",byFWmwlVSmUj-AmM6NZYvw,It's a good burger. They're open late. It's cheap.  I've had In-N-Out a few times and it's never been the religious experience other people seem to have at this place.   I just don't know what I'm missing. I love a good burger...trust me on that one. In-N-Out has just never floored me the way it does some people.   So; once again; in conclusion:  It's a good burger. They're open late. It's cheap.,byFWmwlVSmUj-AmM6NZYvw,Good; cheap; burgers. Fries are/not very greasy; service is excellent; even when busy. Ask for fresh fries. !!!,byFWmwlVSmUj-AmM6NZYvw,"Best \cheap burger lunch\"" on the planet. Fries are made fresh cut in house. I have never eaten a bad lunch here for the last 8 years! Scottsdale also has an in and out on Frank Lloyd Wright. Expect long lines in the drive through with 20 min wait if you get there at noon. Seating can also be limited because of the demand.""",ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,We popped in for a quick bite and ordered the chicken cheesesteak and turkey pesto panini. Chicken is seasoned well; but the panini and salad are AWFUL!!!! 1st and last time for us! Lettuce is wilted and tastes dirty.  Asked for no onions twice and they are piled on! Out of steak and most drinks in the fountain drink dispenser. The dressing tastes like it is all vinegar. Way too pricey ($30) for the quality of the food!!! Save your time and money....,ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,We order from Pita Di Vita about twice per month. Nobody can grill chicken like this guy; it's just fantastic. Very reasonably priced. Probably the kind of place that you order takeout rather than going there to eat- not the greatest eat-in atmosphere. As far as take out goes it can't be beat. Fresh ingredients; health Mediterranean fare; friendly service. I sincerely hope that these guys are around for a long time. The Chicken Philly sandwich and Di Vita salad are our favorites.,ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,YUM YUM YUM!  I went there on a whim and was at first a little worried; since there were zero customers in the small dining area when I walked in.  However; after making a few random selections from the menu (with guidance from the nice girl at the register); I was overly pleased.  The food was DELISH and I have gone back again since.  I would highly recommend the spicy chicken wrap - soooo good!  The prices are very reasonable.  The dining atmosphere isn't awesome; hence the 4-stars (we did carry out both times); but still; I am now a repeat customer!,ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,"I had the spicy chicken wrap. It was really spicy; well...on the bright side; I had lots of water to drink with it.   First of all; the place is a tiny place with no fancy decorations but it is okay if you want to just grab your food to-go. Secondly; they make the food pretty fast. My sisters and I got our order in about 5-7 minutes. One of my sisters had the vegetarian wrap and the other one got a gyro (both really good; too). The only thing I would \complain\"" is the price; my wrap is about $9. Granted; it is big but I don't think it is worth the price. I would come to this place maybe once in a while. So; would I come back here again? Yes. Would I be a regular? Nah.""",ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,Food was great. Got the BBQ pita and tried Philly steak pita. Decent price (9/10); awesome service (10/10); fair atmosphere (5/10) and pretty good selection (7/10). We would definitely go back for lunch; not so much my first choice for dinner.,ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,My 1st experience there started off on the wrong foot; but I enjoyed the food so I gave it a second chance - I'm glad I did.  Knowing I had no cash when I got there I asked if they take debit/credit just to be sure and the cashier said no - only Amex.  Hmmm.  I said ok; strange; and started walking out when she said oh wait they take everything but Amex.  Ok; so I ordered a falafel pita and salad.  Paid; sat down; then found out they were out of falafel; so I got the chix shawarma instead.    The pita was really good; overflowing with fillings; very flavorful; fresh veggies and it was nice & juicy.  The salad was fairly standard Greek fair with mixed greens but it was fresh & tasty.  Generous portions for both; right around $9.  Because I did enjoy the food I went back and got that falafel pita I wanted so much; it was really good as well.  I like that they put some hummus on the falafel pita; and both pitas had plenty of pickles - a favorite of mine.  The place is tidy; has a pretty varied menu; decent prices and so far so good with the food.,ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,Great food at a reasonable price. I have been there a couple of times now and will return. Nothing fancy but good service and tasty pitas. I've had the chicken shawarma and the BBQ chicken. Yum!,ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,First yelp. Be kind. :)  Was Friday lunch when a friend and I decided to try this local joint. It's located in a shopping center; next to the mega Lifetime gym in Gilbert. Easy to miss since it's tucked away in the corner but just know that it is in the same plaza as Zipps Bar and Grill.   The place was quaint; non pretentious; hybrid of a cafe and fast food set up; which is a casual place to relax and catch up with a friend. They have a couple patio sets out front to dine at as well.   Most traffic coming in and out of the restaurant that day was for take out. The menu looked fresh and tasty. Their website is done well and was one of the reasons that got me here in the first place. Prices are good for the amount of food you get.   I ordered the Spicy Chicken Wrap. It was the size of a Chipotle burrito but with much bolder flavors and a punch. It was filled with rice; black beans; chicken in a wonderful spicy sauce; jalapenos and other goodness that tasted really well together. Came with a side of yogurt sauce that helped balance the heat. Really was a great meal enveloped in a warm flour wrap. Couldn't finish the darn thing so let my friend have at it and he agreed to the tastiness. My friend got the Chicken Shawarama which I had a taste. Chicken tender; more fresh veggies so it is lighter than the Spicy Chicken; but still very well seasoned. It's wrapped in a Pita for easy enjoyment! For both; bill was about $13.   In all; great tastes; good prices; easy atmosphere. I would come back.   Only thing that I can dock on was that it was a tad bit slow to get our food considering we were the only ones there and no AC for first 15 minutes of sitting down but I had good company so its a minor critique.,ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,The food here is amazing.  Fresh and prepared to order.  I had the grilled veggies and chicken with the home made hummus (so much better than store bought!). My friend had the chicken platter; both were excellent.  The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars was the price.  I will certainly eat here again; just not as frequently as I might like due to the cost.  But it is certainly worth it for really good Mediterranean food when the craving hits.,ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,The food here is amazing.  Fresh and prepared to order.

Their gyros are amazing and if you ask for the garlic dip and Greek pita you won't be disappointed (although you will smell like garlic the rest of the week) :) try it! Prices are reasonable as well.,ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,Wonderful meal! I had the chicken schawarma by recommendation of the woman taking our order. My husband had the garlic shrimp. Both were delicious. This is a very casual; clean environment; paper plates; plastic forks etc. but decent prices. Nice people; good customer service. No booze.,ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,I went in for lunch with a friend and we told the guy at the register that we were visiting the restaurant for the first time. He immediately gave us a thoughtful recommendation and we ended up ordering what he had suggested. I got the Philly Gyro; my friend got the Chicken Curry; and we split a side order of hummus. The weather was nice so we decided to eat outdoors on their patio. We started with the hummus and it was excellent--our server told us that it is made from scratch in-house. The main entr_e came out a few minutes later and it was delicious.   To top things off; our server brought us out a small dessert on the house in order to thank us for stopping by.  In summary: excellent service; reasonable price; and excellent food.  I would recommend this place highly to anyone!,ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,Wow. So; if you live in Arizona; you've probably heard of Pita Jungle. They have locations in Chandler; Tempe; and Scottsdale. Now don't get me wrong; I like Pita Jungle a whole lot; and this is not a knock against them; but this mom and pop spot has them beat-HANDS DOWN :)  First off; the portions you receive are larger. This is quite the opposite of recent trends with restaurants increasing prices and reducing their portion sizes. This place doesn't have that problem. You will leave feeling very satisfied.   The quality of the ingredients was great. I could see the owner and cook in the back; so I knew my food was fresh. I purchased a combo; and chose a Greek salad as the side (a nice option); and I was very pleased that I could get a whole wheat pita.   They also serve salads and paninis. Menu is diverse; without it being overcrowded.   Definitely stop by if you are in the area. It's worth the trip. :),ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,The hummus here is to die for!  You can definitely tell that everything is made fresh.  The prices are decent as well.  My husband and I visit Pita Di Vita at least once a week.,ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,I went in a little skeptical and was pleasantly surprised.  The location is a bit confusing to get to; but once you're in there; the ambiance is clean and cozy.  The food choices are good and the plates I ordered were delicious.  The greens in my sandwich were fresh and crisp; the meat portions were generous. It was a great lunch; great food at a great price.,ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,Definitely not gourmet fare; but if you're looking for a dang good gyro at a reasonable price; this place delivers.,ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,Update:  Hold the presses!  Tonight I returned to Pita di Vita and just discovered a salad that would launch a thousand ships.  Helen of Troy move over!   I ordered the Shrimp de Sol salad.  Was it cosmic convergence or dumb luck that found me the sort of salad that seduces you into eating it and then satisfies every part of your palate?  Even a manly man could sit down to this heaping bowl of garden greens; red onions; black beans; sweet corn; avocado; gourmet dressing; and grilled  jumbo-sized shrimp and satisfy the deep hunger that lingers within.  Add to that ensemble a soft; warm pita topped with artisan cheese and you have love.  Hey; I am not afraid to say that I was beside myself in consuming this magnificent culinary feat.  Beautiful salad.  Do I love thee?  Let me count the ways.      Original Review: Ate at Pita di Vita last night.  Thumbs way up!!!  Most of the trainers at Funktional Fitness swear by this place so I had to go see what all the rage was about.  It's true.  The rich variety of pita offerings is impressive.  I had the falafel pita.  It rocked--and falafel pitas and I go way back.  The salads and paninis look very inviting.  The ingredients were fresh.  The service was professional and fast.  The guy who owns the place is really friendly.  Lots of good looking; healthy people stop by given that this place is next to a very popular workout scene.  I highly recommend that you stop by.  They have something for everyone at an affordable price.  Eat well. Be well.,ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,Stumbled upon this little gem as it is nestled in a strip mall next to my gym. The hubby and I needed a quick bite to eat one day for lunch and this sounded good. We love hummus and pitas so why not.   Very low key atmosphere nothing special on the inside but the food is so yummy! They were really busy both times I stopped but I would recommend that they invest in the decor and menu approach as at first glance it doesn't compare to the good.  I love their picante hummus (cilantro and jalapenos) and their warm pitas are really good. My husband had a barbecue chicken wrap  that looked really good and he said that he enjoyed. Since our first visit I have ordered hummus and extra pitas on take out and they are really fast!  With lower prices and yummy food - not to mention the proximity to my house I think Pita di Vita is replacing Pita Jungle for me.,ukTwFX4wQW4FbQbnWI9aJg,My family and I ate at Pita Di Vita again tonight - and many nights in between my last review - and I think it just gets better! I love their garlic shrimp side - and at 5 shrimp for $5.95 the price can't be beat.  Still love their picante hummus and the chicken hummus is delicious! We will continue to eat at this location and with my crazy craving for their food we will continue to eat here often!!!,638KbE3REls3O3bbOPLnUA,Maybe it was all the hype; maybe it was the high prices; or maybe it just wasn't that good.  I dunno; I suppose that I have high standards when it comes to a sandwich - and in all my years this is the 1st Italian sandwich I've ever had that just overwhelmed me with sweetness (for the record; NOT a flavor most want on a sandwich not involving peanut butter or Nutella).  I'm guessing it was the mustard that caused the sweet flavor - taking that off might improve the whole thing greatly - but it was also soggy by the time I got home.    Major points for the modern age Coke machine (with a gajillion flavor combinations) but that's not enough to woo me.  It's a good idea to steam your meats and cheeses; I imagine that does change the flavor profile a bit; but not enough to charge me ten bucks for a soggy / sweet footlong.  I might be back; but mostly for the freakin' cool soda machine.  Until they can be beaten; Jersey Mikes still takes the pickle for one of the best sandwich franchises ever.,638KbE3REls3O3bbOPLnUA,Subs are good.  Reason I gave a 3 star is because I feel the customer service and time can step it up.  Second time I have been here and both times they are very slow at making the subs.    Tonight I walked in and order 3 subs.  I am the only customer in the joint.  4 employees working.  I place my order.  After I place my order; the cashier goes and sweeps;one gal starts to make the subs; another employee is cleaning the counter along the back wall and another is doing something else.  One would think that maybe another employee would stop what they were doing to help make 3 subs.  Nope; left it up to the girl and she was very slow.  A few other people walk in and order and then another employee starts on their subs.  Mind you; my order is still not complete.  I think I will stick with Subway next time.  More options; less expensive. Faster service and it still fills me up.,638KbE3REls3O3bbOPLnUA,I will have to go back and perhaps try a hook and ladder. I went for the first time and ordered the meatball. On the board it says that it includes Italian sausage but there was none on my sandwich. The service was good but I'm not convinced it was worth the price.,638KbE3REls3O3bbOPLnUA,The map is wrong on this; it is just south of germann off of gilbert rd on the east side of gilbert rd.  The food is pretty damn tasty. The white chicken salad sandwich is good. Prices are reasonable and they have an awesome pop machine that has over 100 different sodas or something crazy like that.  The old man who works the register; at least during lunch the last 2 Thursdays I have gone; should be in a home. He is so over matched by the entire ordering process that it is painful. He has gotten my sandwich wrong both times even though I knew he was struggling and tried to even point to the menu to tell him what I wanted. Luckily they can remake the sandwiches quickly but I've seen multiple people turn their sandwiches back in; I'm guessing for the same reason.  If you own this place; PLEASE let that employee go or find him a new position; he is NOT able to handle the register. All 4 of the other employees made sure to welcome me when I walked in but he is the one that has to ring me up? When I brought my incorrect sandwich back and told them this was the 2nd week in a row he did the same thing; they laughed and said he is a good guy. I bet he is; just not a good register person.  I love the help the firemen angle and $ going back to their charities and all; but please hire a competent register worker.,qlgAl9biUkK1wvmJ4ggDFg,Stay away at all costs. The last couple of trips thru the drive thru; everytume the order has been wrong. Of course you dont find this out till you get home. Diet Coke given instead of regular coke(which was ordered) and they are very stingy with the fries. Always 1/2 filled. Drive up to Burger King right up the street.,qlgAl9biUkK1wvmJ4ggDFg,Worst McDonald's ever. It's not the fact that they can never seem to get my order right; but trying to get it corrected is more hassle than its worth. Food is usually cold anyway. But it's  their management that's the worst. They treat you like the idiot; when it's their fault to begin with. If you call the posted customer service number; don't bother it's a recording and still have not received a callback. Avoid at all costs.,#NAME?,Sub tasted OK; priced. Bit high...my wife and I were no impressed and we eat at many restaurants and fast food joints.  Staff was not feeling it; it was close to closing so they looked like they wanted to be anywhere but at work.  Whole experience was kinda lame.,#NAME?,"Expensive but worth it!  You pay more than you would at Subway; but you get a much  much better sandwich. Don't be put off by the description of \Hot Sanwiches\"" on the menu.  I think they only heat them to melt the cheese.""",#NAME?,I wont be returning to this chain anytime soon; it was pricey for a sub and there are better options around. This place reminds me of 5 guys hamburger joint; but I liked that place better than this one. I ate my food and went on my way and havent went back since. I suggest you try it atleast once the food is decent and it will go down just fine but after you look at the reciept you may wish you went to Subway or just made one yourself.,#NAME?,Really really really good food. Love the drink options... You can nearly choose anything you want from the machine. I cringe to see the one reviewer here comparing this place to Subway. Laughable. Sorry... Of course Subway is cheaper. Their ingredients are cheap... Firehouse has a really well made sub and it can't be compared to the sh-tuff Subway makes.,#NAME?,Love this place as an option to subway and lunch choices. Fresh food; great service; clean; lots of space; timely and not horrible prices. I love the Italian and cheesesteak. Great soda machines and two TVs with sports. Very addicting.,#NAME?,Solid sub alternative to Subway & Quiznos. Just had a medium Hook & Ladder fully involved; which means lettuce; tomato; onion and mayo. Price was a bit higher than Subway @5.99 but I'm alright with that because I can sample a variety of hot sauces. See; I'm a closet chili head. They only put up to 7 (on a scale of 1 to 10) on display so beginners don't get hurt. The nice girl behind the counter said they keep the HOT stuff in the back. So; go try the sub of your choice and while your waiting grab a spoon and sample the goods.,#NAME?,This place ranks better than most sub places.  It has great flavors. Hot; toasted sub's.  And good prices.   Just wish they would add another soda fountain machine.  Have to stand in line to access the only one; usually behind children that cannot make up their mind and want to play with it.!!,#NAME?,Great sandwiches. A little too pricey or else I would give 5 stars. Environment is great. Amazing selection of hot sauces. Very happy with customer service the times that I have visited this location.,#NAME?,Heard that this place was opened recently and decided to give it a try. Outstanding!!  I ordered the Club- turkey; ham and bacon fully loaded. Made fresh and brought to your table. The staff greets everyone as they walk in; all smiling. Service time was pretty good considering they were packed.  For the value- price is fair not great but hey; firemen founded it!!,#NAME?,Great atmosphere;  short wait time and reasonable prices. I had the #2 the meatball subs; it was awesome. I'm definitely satisfied and coming back here again. :-),wn7GiuOQ_0VrPXNc1wVTDA,Inspired by recent Talk; this rating simply must be updated.  Fatburger has a QUALITY-quality that places it in a wierd limbo between other fast food burgers and places like Fuddruckers.  If you are a fan of the king; either of the two clowns; or the red haired girl; then Fatburger is likely to feel too expensive and that it takes too long.  However; 'you get what you pay for' and 'good things are worth waiting for'.    Freshness; a multitude of assembly choices; and overall quality are big standouts at Fatburger.  The employees at this location have always been friendly and courteous.  Tuesdays: buy a combo; get another burger free!,wn7GiuOQ_0VrPXNc1wVTDA,4 stars for a fried burger... not a bad rating from this burger snob.   I prefer a flame grilled 1/2lb burger not a flat fried 1/3lb... but quality makes up for this.   While it is very close to a 5 guys burger; i like that my burger was not well done. It is def better then all the fast food joints; less greasy then Johnny Rockets; but not as good as Fudds.   The staff was nice; the place was a little dirty around the edges and can use a good scrub. Prices seemed good for what you get.   I could be back sooner then later.,wn7GiuOQ_0VrPXNc1wVTDA,Never going back.  First of all it's way too expensive for the crappy food we received.  The fries were nothing special and tasted worse than the kind that come frozen that you bake in the oven.  Customer service was rude and very unhelpful.  There's also a sign there that says they make all burgers medium well and mine had lots of pink in it (which I hate of course).,wn7GiuOQ_0VrPXNc1wVTDA,This was my first visit to fat burger it was a fat disappointment! Restaurant was dirty it took forever for the burger to come and when it did it had no taste very blan no seasoning at all only pepper. This place was over priced for the quality and service of the food in my opinion if you charge restaurant  prices you should serve restaurant quality. This place charges 10.00 for a burger and an extra 1.00 for cheese and 1.00 for every extra you get on the burger the meal did come with onion rings that were the only good part of this meal. They should call this place fat onion rings because the burger was dry and tasteless I will not return to this place I live close by and was really hoping this would be my new burger joint:(,wn7GiuOQ_0VrPXNc1wVTDA,Though a bit pricey with not a lot of options; their burgers are juicy and delicious. It's a higher quality; thicker patty on a well made (though not in-house) bun. I get mine with just lettuce; mayo and cheese but you can get it loaded with toppings for the same price. I also got skinny fries but there are also a lot of fry/side options including steak fries; onion rings; or a salad.  If you got a little extra to spend but still want a fast burger; Fatburger is the place to go.,LFOfaMvC6g7huKW5e35nsQ,"Stopped here for breakfast the other day.  I love their biscuits!  I got a chicken biscuit and a 4 piece Chick Fil A chicken minis.  Total was just a bit over 5 bucks.  Here is how they were..........  Chicken Biscuit- Delicious!  My favorite thing from this restaurant.  I prefer it over their chicken sandwiches and everything else.  The biscuit is soft; buttery and delicious.  The chicken is always prepared perfectly.  I should have gotten 2 of these.  You will see why; next.  Chick Fil A Minis-  Eh...they were just alright.  A bit skimp for the price.  The \buns\"" they use for these things are like cinnamon rolls without the heavy icing.  They are kind of hard to describe.  I didn't really enjoy them though.  They had an almost \""stale\"" taste/texture to them.  The chicken pieces were super skimp too.  I almost guarantee that those 4 mini pieces of chicken didn't add up to/equal what is in their biscuits.  I would not get these again.  Service is always friendly.  They are sincere and treat everyone well.  This place is pretty close to my house so I'm sure I will be back.""",LFOfaMvC6g7huKW5e35nsQ,Kinda pricey for not a lot or high quality food. I do love their sweet tea and milkshakes tho!!,LFOfaMvC6g7huKW5e35nsQ,Food is ok... I think its a bit overpriced though.. Service is good.. Just not a big fan..,LFOfaMvC6g7huKW5e35nsQ,This is a great place to get a protein packed chicken sandwich fast. The people that work here are friendly and the drive thru moves pretty fast. I only wish they were open on Sundays for my afternoon workout post meal. Other than that I like this place and that says a lot coming from me. Only downside is that it does get pricey but you get what you pay for and it's better than McDonalds (Which I never eat)!!!,LFOfaMvC6g7huKW5e35nsQ,The only surprise here is that it's just as amazing every time I come in. Not only is the chicken amazing but the people are so nice it seems almost like they are there just for me.  Definitely try them out.  Today I got a Grilled Chicken Cool Wrap with Spicy dressing; the wrap was not overwhelming and the bread actually had flavor; i didn't tear away prices like I do with most wraps at fast food joints.,LFOfaMvC6g7huKW5e35nsQ,Really enjoy their chicken sandwiches. They are never dry and always super moist. The prices are a bit higher than I would like; but it's not a bad deal. My kids love their chicken nuggets but they are not big fans of the waffle fries. I would prefer regular fries over waffle ones.   I know they are closed on Sundays for religious beliefs maybe that's why we had to wait in the drive thru for 20 minutes. They were definitely packed at almost 2pm.,LFOfaMvC6g7huKW5e35nsQ,Chicken sandwich is good; always fresh vegetables! Fast and friendly costumer service! Always clean and the staff is polite!  The fries are my favorite and also the part is free refills on the drinks!  I give it a 5 stars because I've been to many Chick-Fil-A's across the states and i always get the same exceptional service!  Good food!,hP3hxJBx1GdCfF4RVhqbAg,Chipotle is Chipotle is Chipotle. Love the outdoor seating; the margarita options; and the fast; friendly service. It is a great location at Westgate and while others are fighting for a seat at the regular sit down restaurants; you can count on quality; consistent food at reasonable prices at this Chipotle location.,hP3hxJBx1GdCfF4RVhqbAg,"In terms of fast food; Chipotle is one of my favorites. This location used to be \Moe's\"" which was much the same. Food was a bit heavier and greasier but burritos came with all you can eat salsa. Chipotle does not and their chips and salsa is rather expensive. So if you haven't been to this location in a while; you may be disappointed.  But overall the food is good and the staff here is friendly.""",hP3hxJBx1GdCfF4RVhqbAg,This review is not about the food. The food at the Chipotle restaurants are generally the same in quality and taste. I have never had an issue with the taste of the food while being a consumer at this location but I have had terrible service time and time again.   I work close to this location ; at a company at Westgate. Myself and fellow co workers come to Chipotle often since there aren't many options in Westgate during the day at lunch time . Well; there is Buffalo Wild Wins; Which Which and Mama Gina's but everything gets really old; really fast. Chipotle has something for everyone ; so we go there.   The taste of the food is fine and the portion of food provided is AMAZING if you are a 5 year old child. You order a burrito bowl and or burrito and you get 2 servings of rice ; veggies and everything else by default and then when it comes to meat; you get a child portion. When you look confused and or concerned and ask for a little more they  respond by asking if you want double meat; which is an extra cost of course.  The chicken; steak and other meats are what make the meal. Not cheese; lettuce; hot sauce and beans. Those are used as fillers here. Where else do you go and spend 10 bucks for a burrito with meat in it that would better accommodate a taco?  I did not want to really speak about the customer service since I will not include employee names; although I have them. Often times you leave feeling rushed. If you change your mind; please expect a roll of the eyes. Trust that someone will be upset because you as the customer want to add beans last minute. How DARE you ask for your monies worth!!?  I really wish I did not have to create an account just to write this review but I had to. I have been working near this location and helping jeep them in business since January and I have been wanting to write this and or write corporate forever and just kept saying it fast food; its fine; it will get better.   It unfortunately does not; at least at this location!!!,gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,My hubby is from Detroit and this is AUTHENTIC.

The hot dog had a nice \bite\"" to it from the slightly elastic casing; adding a nice textural difference from the rest of the hot dog. The chili was somewhat reminiscent of some Cincinnati style chili I've had from Skyline Chili; except with more of a savory flavor to it. It went well with the onion; mustard; and hot dog.   Service was excellent; and the owner was very friendly and came by to make sure everything was tasting OK.

Still living here today; I haven't actually had a real coney (just chili and hot dog really).  One day I was searching Yelp for a new place to try; and I typed in \Coney Dogs\"" and came across this place.  5 star average with over 100 reviews?  Must be a decent place to try.  Walked in and it was pretty dead (Weekday perhaps the reason).  We instantly got greeted (aint gonna lie; the girl there was a cutie) and was told that the Coneys today was buy one get one half off.  So anyways; the menu is pretty simple for the most part (not that it's a bad thing) and the prices are a wee bit high.  I got the Coney Combo (coney/loose beef) and a side of chili cheese fries.  I also got to try Faygo for the 1st time (don't have it out here; always wanted to try it).  Ended getting the Rock and Rye.  The hot dog itself was normal size for a hot dog; even with beef and everything; $5 was just a little too high.  The chili was good and the fries were good too ($3.95 for the fries).  Overall the food was pretty good.  One thing that I didn't care for (not a big onion guy) was the pile of onions on my dog.  Just reduce it some and it's perfect (for me anyways).  Next time I must try the burger (perhaps the Quint?)  So I overheard the owner talking about adding another location from reviews on Yelp and I think the Val Vista and 60 location would be more ideal because that plaza brings in a ton of business.""",gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,This place has really good food and really good prices. Good amount of food for the money always prepared fresh to order. They have a loose burger which is really good recommend trying,gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,Amazing food; good prices.  Would love a location near frank lloyd wright and the 101!  Thanks!,gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,Staff was friendly; prices were reasonable; and the food was quick and delicious. The meat is ground in house; and the patties are thin and layered; with cheese between each slice (or so it seemed). Do yourself a favor and add avocado.   I loved my Cajun fries; while my husband thought the regular fries were good; but a touch soggy. I didn't notice that at all; though it could be because I dumped a ton of malt vinegar on them.   Either way; this is one of the best burgers either of us have had in Phoenix.,gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,So happy that this place opened. I'm almost embarrassed to admit how much I've missed hanis since I moved here from MI 5 years ago.  My husband and I got the hanis; chili dog and chili cheese fries with Rock & Rye obviously!  Everything was just how we remembered it to be.  Oh and BTW  to all the cheapy reviewers I could not care less if they charge $2.50 for a Faygo.  If you can't afford $2.50 then you shouldn't be going out to eat in the first place; this isn't a soup kitchen it's a restaurant if you don't want to pay the price drink water; kay?  The owner and his staff are super nice and all from MI - I would expect nothing less.  If you are from MI and miss the Coney Island staples check this place out you won't be disappointed...if you're not then try it for the first time; it's worth it.,gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,So happy that this place opened.

This new fast-casual burger and dog joint looks like it might as well be a seasoned chain; but it's a new concept in a formerly failing strip. This and the neighboring restaurant; Hummus Xpress; have resurrected this location from the dead.   The food here is fantastic. Everything seems fresh and high quality. Even though the prices are fast-food low; you're definitely getting a lot of bang for your buck. The owner is pretty nice and has a lot of experience running local restaurants. He's usually there and he is very proud (as he should be) of his place and happy to tell you all about what you're eating and how they grind their own meat for the burger patties. That's always a good sign for me - an owner and staff who give a shit about their restaurant.   I ate a double cheeseburger with bacon and avocado and paired it with some curly fries. It was one of the best burgers I've had in the Valley. If you're a big fan of In and Out Burger or Five Guys; you should really give this place a try because it's not only better; it blows those places away. You can get your burger topped with just about whatever you want; and after you order you can watch them disassemble a whole potato and toss it in some hot oil for you.   Don't be intimidated or discouraged if you see a long line out the door at lunchtime because it moves really fast; and the register is up near the door so that's gonna happen. Rumor has it that they might start offering delivery soon after lunch. Makes me wish I lived a little closer. With the kind of detail and thought that went into this concept; they might have plans to open more locations eventually - looking forward to that.,gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,"Awesome employees; great atmosphere; top-notch food; and fair prices. No doubt that these are the elements that set Detroit Coney Grill apart from other restaurants in the area. I hesitate to use the word \competitor\"" here; as the Coney Grill has no clear competitors. It's just an old-school vibe that makes every visit feel like time well spent. When combined with the quality product; there might not be a better casual dining experience than the one to be had at theDetroit Coney Grill.""",gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,In the state of Michigan there exists a particular type of hot dog known as a coney. Why is it called a coney? No one knows. As far as I know it's not named after Coney Island in New York. It's not named after the SNL sketch turned 90s movie the Coneheads either; and it's not named after Joseph Kony the leader of the Ugandan resistance movement.   What is a Coney hot dog you might be asking? Well it's a hot dog with a chilli; mustard and onion. This differs a bit from a regular chilli dog due to the mustard to balance out the chilli flavor.   And this brings me to Detroit Coney Grill; while in the metropolitan Phoenix area I checked around with local yelpers to help me track down hot dog places to review and this was one of those recommendations. So one afternoon I set my sights on visiting Detroit Coney Grill and giving it a try.  The restaurant itself has a fair bit of seating available with one long counter encompassing both where you order and where your food is prepared. I went for a coney dog and water and within a few minutes my food was ready and it was time to dig in. The hot dog had a lot of very nice tasting meaty chilli on it; the combination of the chilli mixed with the mustard was nice and the sausage itself tasted good. This was a skinless sausage on a regular seedless bun. There were a lot of diced onions on top that added to the mix. Overall this was an excellent combination of ingredients and a very satisfying hot dog.   If I had to complain about anything it's that it was a tad pricey; it was a little over 4.00 for the hot dog and a cup of water. I will say that this was a far better tasting hot dog with chilli as the primary ingredient than the one I had at Ted's also located in Tempe Arizona; but for the same price roughly I got a footlong there. Overall I'd say my food was excellent but the value was a little lacking. I am going to give Detroit Coney Grill a solid four stars and a recommendation.,gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,We're from Southern California so I'll start by saying..were used to extremely rude people and very basic food. This place gives me hope for society. The workers are very nice and the food is good.   Hospitality? A+.  Food? A+. Price? A+.  There were 6 of us and our food took less than 10 minutes. Their boxed water is to die for and their faygo pops are great as well. Detroit feeling in Arizona you can't beat it. They gave us some chips to try as well that were great. We would definitely come back...unless they opened one in CALIFORNIA!!!! Hehe. Thanks guys!!,gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,The guys here at DCG have some serious passion for the Coney Dog and the action they have going on is pretty cool as well. Inside is full of fun items to make you feel like you're back in the Detroit area and then some. Take your time and check out the walls.  I've never been to Michigan but do love THE DOG. Been here a couple times and usually order a couple of their famous Coney Combos. Even broke down and had to test out some of the Chili Cheese Fries. Nice!  Really like the way the Dog pops in your mouth as you bite into them. The Hand Cut Fries are made fresh to order and you can definitely tell the difference. They also have Burgers; Pitas; Salads and boneless Chicken Wings as well.  The food is pretty good and most people seem to rate this place rather high. I'm inclined to go with an A-OK since the Chili or Coney sauce just did not have much of a thrill factor or flavor profile for me and the hotdogs are little on the pricey side.  Give them a try and see what you think. This is one of those regional flavors that you are going to enjoy more if you are from that area. I tend to lean toward the Windy City when hankering for a special treat. BEEP BEEP!  3.5 STARS,gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,Come here for an excellent hot dog or burger experience.  I found this place on Yelp as I was headed to the Phoenix airport and needed to grab a quick bit before turning in the rental car.  This place is about 5 minutes for the airport; so worth a stop if you want better than the captive airport food options.  And the price is super reasonable.  The chili on both the dogs and burgers is excellent; and the hand-cut fries are tasty when they are hot.  The staff are super friendly and helpful.  I highly recommend trying this place if in the mood for a good snappy dog/coney.,gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,"walk in and BOOM you know your in an authentic Detroit run place. The manager or maybe the owner (im not sure) was ringing people up and you can tell he is definitely from Detroit. They have a cool map of Detroit and some push pins with a sign saying \put it where you come from\"" I dont think he would of liked it if i asked him to pull out a map of Ohio haha. O-H. but moving on. The place is small but has good seating and pretty good prices. The food itself was AMAZING. I got 2 Detroit Coney Dogs -onion. Simple i know but its easy to mess the chili on it up; and they sure didnt. The guys were awesome who were making the food. Very polite and everyone seemed happy to be there. I live right around the corner and ill absolutely be back. oh and btw they have a 10% check in marked off your bill. I just threw the difference in the tip jar. I consider this to be a nice hidden gem. I hope they expand and get some more recognition.  Thanks guys.""",gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,Overall the food is good but I am actually from Detroit and they're prices are not like this. I mean 3.95 for a coney? That's crazy high! The coney island my family goes to in detroit has coneys for 1.85 and on Wednesdays its 99 cent! The fries are a very small size and the last time I went; the chili cheese fries were salty. Really? Salt on fries that's gonna be under chili and cheese. And SAVE YOUR MONEY ON THE FAYGO! Their faygo is like the old time Coca-Cola bottles and their like $3. Here's a tip: faygo is at ajs fine foods and QT! Again good food; crappy hours and prices,gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,OMG...just like the original coneys in Detroit! !

I went there for a dog but I saw someone eating a juicy burger so I changed my mind.  Drink; fries and a delicious cheeseburger for all under $8 bucks.  The person who took my order explained that my burger order number will be called out and then they will ask me what fixings I want \like subway\"" he said.  I thought that was a pretty cool feature and they had a nice selection of burger toppings.  The guy who cooked my burger; served it to me at my table and then cleaned up my table when I was done; what a superstar employee.

From the smells; the tastes; the menu offerings and everyone's friendly demeanor; from the staff to the patrons. They need a sign on the wall when you walk in that says. \If You're From Detroit; Welcome Home!\""  I'm originally from Oak Park; Michigan (a suburb of Detroit) and two of the things I miss the most are the food and the general kindness with which people treat each other there. Found out the owner (Dave? David?) is also from Oak Park (and used to live about 5 blocks from where I used to live!). They have regular hot dogs there and they have Coney's. The Coney is a hot dog with a natural casing; so it 'snaps' when you bite into it. My wife and I have driven to the famous Pink's hotdogs in Hollywood and had great chili dogs there; and this place stacks right up against them in every way!  The coney's are amazing. The fries are made just the way I make them at home myself. The people that work there and eat there are all very friendly and love to talk about reminiscing where we're all from and if you remember this place or that place back in the day back home (Detroit).  What a great place! Good prices; hours are kinda weird (closes at 7:30pm on weekdays and closed on Sundays) and it can be a little difficult to find as its smashed into the middle of a crowded strip mall with a medical marijuana license distributor a few stores down.  We made the trip from Glendale to try this place out and I was so impressed! I wish it was closer! But I predict I'll be making the drive again soon - and often! (Update - I've been there four times now and it seems like it just keeps getting better every time I go. Food is consistently great and people are consistently friendly and the service is consistent as well).  Loved having Vernor's in the glass bottle; and looking forward to trying the burgers next time; as well. (Update - we tried the sliders; which are a menu option only offered on certain days - they were amazing!)  They also just started offering Boston Coolers on the menu on Friday's and Saturday's. For those who don't know or remember; a Boston Cooler is Vernors blended with French Vanilla ice cream (almost like a root beer float). It is so good - and if you've never had one; I guarantee it tastes like nothing else you've ever had (in a good way!).  Trivia - Why is it called a Boston Cooler when it's from Detroit? It was named after Detroit's Boston Boulevard where it was reportedly first served. The history of the Boston Cooler has some conflicts. One story says that Mr. Sanders invented the drink at his store on the east side of Woodward Ave near Boston Blvd. The other story; and the one I like better; is that the drink was invented during Prohibtion by Grandpa Vernor for his grandchildren. According to legend; there was a milk man who delivered to the Vernor household. In his wagon he carried Strohs Ice Cream (Strohs had to give up brewing beer and changed their fire-brewed kettles over to ice cream production). James Vernor Sr. lived on Grosse isle but would visit the grandkids in Detroit. During one summer visit in 1921 the milkman and Grandpa Vernor delevoped a friendship and between the two of them they concocted the mixture of Strohs vanilla ice cream and Vernors Ginger Ale. It was called a Boston Cooler because the house was on Boston Blvd.  Detroit Coney Grill is a great place! Highly Recommended! Hidden Gem!!!  Also; I just learned they are getting ready to open another location on the west side of town (maybe 35th Ave and Bell Road?) That's a lot closer to my house; so I'm sure I will be eating there more often!

We had the coney's and the burger.  Both were delicious! They use the chili made in Detroit and even stay true to the experience and serve Faygo pop and Better Made chips! It has to be expensive to ship these products here; but it is key to making this place authentic; nostalgic and true to the food!

Totally worth the money.   Chili dog + cheese fries + Faygo = perfect,gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,Found this place while waiting for car to get repaired; awesome food; service and prices! Calling their regulars by name.,gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,Where do I start. The coney dogs are great!  The hot dogs are very good and the chili has great flavor. I did the Coney Special and it included 2 coney dogs; a boat of fries; and a drink for $8.88. Tons of food. Super cheap.   The Better Made Honey BBQ chips rock. They are soooo good. I love them. I looked on the package and they are made in Detroit.   My husband had a Philly cheesesteak pita. It was freshly made and tasted so good. The meat was cooked perfectly and the flavors commingled together very well.   My only complaint is that they didn't have tea. Said they didn't have tea bags. I already purchased a drink and had to go and purchase a bottle of water too.,gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,"FINALLY ! A huge thank you to David for bringing a real deal Detroit coney to Phoenix. He took the time to explain to this former Detroiter the finer points of his business; the quality meats he uses (from Detroit); and convey his sincere desire to succeed. This restaurateur earns your business the right way... prompt; friendly; great food; and a clean \shop\""  The spice in the coney sauce is PERFECT ...recommend the Coney Special (you will want a fork). You could hop on a plane and drive to 118 W Lafayette Blvd; close your eyes; and taste the same exact coney dog...  priceless Bonus points for having Faygo and Better-Made chips and a legit Hani - Much success to the owner; earned this repeat customer with one visit.""",gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,"Drove up from Tucson. Great Coneys and Faygo too! After finishing off the Coney dogs; we had to go back and try a \loose\""; which is a hot dog bun filled with loose hamburger meat; and topped with chili; mustard and onion. It's a Detroit specialty!  Reasonable prices. Worth the trip.""",gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,Good food; Detroit loose burger was great; the Detroit Coney Combo was outstanding; fresh cut fries was very good.  Prices were very reasonable.  Granddaughter had the double burger thought it was super.  Owner was very hands on and made the experience even more enjoyable,gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,Hot dogs are ok.  Not exactly what I would get when in Ann Arbor but still not bad.  Prices are on the high side for a hot dog.   Not sure if I will be back.  This place definitely does a good lunch business though.,gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,Temporary fix for a Midwest staple. I've been here in Arizona for a little over 5 years . Moving from Detroit I stayed eating at a Coney Island at least one meal of the day. So when I heard of the Detroit coney grill I was very excited; an to find out that they were getting their chilli from one of the best if not oldest coneys in Detroit; made it Mir appealing. When I told my wife that there was a coney in the valley we decided to check it out. When we made if to the location I knew I was in the right place. Several people leaving the place with their Detroit tigers fitted I felt at home for a quick second. The vibe inside was nice; some photos on the wall of certain Michigan team an a few other things Detroit. So now we get to the food which is really the reason that we came. Unlike most of the other people who have given reviews I was somewhat unimpressed by the menu as well as pricing an hours. Understand this; I am Detroit in every way shape an form. I've said on many occasions that if there were a coney out here that was exactly how we have them back home you would have a winner. Although the food is nice here; it's menu is missing so much that would make this a great place to go. I don't want to just go to a spot because its reminds me somewhat of home. And I think that this is what's happening with this place. So many people from Michigan have moved out here to the valley that anytime that you hear of anything from home you want to check it out. Coneys are a 24/7 grill with sooooo much to choose from on the menu you sometimes stand at the counter trying hard to make a decision on what to get. Burgers an coney fries are nice however just a scratch of the surface. And 2 bucks for a faygo is highway robbery; especially when you can go to certain qts or circle k's an get a 20 oz for 1 buck. The guy told us that they charge that much because it cost so much to send them out here. I know some may see this as a raggin rant; however it's not. In order to stand the test of time with a business you have to look at everything your patrons are saying an try to make adjustments. If not that same thing can turn around and bite you. Hopefully this is just a start to a great establishment in the valley. I'll be back to see if anything has changed. #whatupdoe,gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,Delicious; cheap; friendly.  You obviously don't have to be from Detroit to enjoy it; but if you are; there's definitely a sense of nostalgia.  Highly recommended.,gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,The guys who run this place are great but the coney itself didn't blow me away. It's pretty small for the price and I actually enjoyed eating the fries more than the dog. Check in on Yelp for a meal discount.

The staff were super friendly and the price is really good for the amount of food you get!,gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,I love this place.  From the first visit; I knew this was a joint I would frequent whenever I come to town for work.  In fact; I have my coworker addicted to this place now.  We decided that since this place is so great; it's on the short list of places to go with the company cool kids secret club.    The customer service is great; like really great.  The owner is helladope.  He always has an exuberant greeting; handshake; or hug for me whenever I come in.  The guys behind the counter are always super friendly and helpful.  Didn't know you needed a spoon and ketchup?...don't fret; they knew you did and they'll bring it to you.  The prices are low.  You can fill yourself up to bursting for less than twenty bucks.  There are quite a few things on the menu; but why would you get anything other than the Detroit Coney?  The hot dogs are great.  You know you're eating a good dog when it snaps when you bite into it.  The onions could be a little bit more oniony for me with just a little bit more bite to 'em.  The chili-fries are so so good.  I can feel my arteries clogging with every delicious bite and if I have a fat-girl heart attack on the way out of the door; it'll be worth it.  They also carry a bunch of Faygo; but you need not paint on your ICP face to have any.  I've had a few other things; but it's really all about the hot dogs and fries.,gEAB85-Zcm8Qs5JQPC_PHg,"What is it that makes this place so special? I had the Combo Coney Dog; that isn't chili dog..  and it did nothing to me. Hot-dogs are substandard food no matter how much you pay for it. And the chili on top was no culinary experience at all. it made my hot-dog bun soggy. It had no great flavor; nor was in special in any fashion.   The service is good though.. just a little too much Disney over the whole \we're so genuine\"". I find it parodying true home pride.. and not in a good way. It looks clean but it is a fast food place; and I am trying to figure out what it is that people like with this place. The food isn't anything special. There is no ambiance to speak of. So what is it? They are nce here; they are. But it becomes a theme park kinda thing. \""We have all this Genuine Detroit kinda hot dogs and stuff\""... Ohyeah; looks and taste like normal hot-dog to me.  (I was leaning to the cheese fries. in my mind it would be fries slightly overdone; a hint of vinegar and topped with some interesting hard cheese flavor. But instead it is same fries w nacho cheese (you know the crap you cannot legally refer to as cheese). I didn't try it. I saw it. So happy i didn't go that route.)  Yes; they sell some stuff like Faygo that is good and all; but all-in-all you pay for a meal that's suppose to reflect something that doesn't really exists. It's a hot dog stand with a gimmick.  A gimmick that I can't even grasp. That is it - and promoting the emperors new clothes is not my thing.   Best part of my meal - overpriced Faygo. I will not suggest to come back here.""",XA-mMT47rFZNEllPBCYWQQ,If the food weren't so good; this Chipotle would represent my idea of one of the nine circles of Hell.  Enter on the wrong weekday evening during peak dinner hours; and you will feel like you're stuck in the middle of a daycare center.  Little kids run around as if they're in a McDonald's Play Place; but since there is no play area; they're just running around the restaurant.  If you're picking up food at this time; do yourself a huge favor and order it online to-go.  The 27 minute line (I'm not exaggerating; I timed it on my cellphone) is to be expected at 6:30 on a Wednesday night; but the crammed crowd and noise was pretty hard to bare.  Parking is also a regular pain at this shopping center.  I am not a kid hater.  I also understand that these issues are not entirely Chipotle's fault (which is why the place still gets four stars).  It's the parents job to keep their kids in line and it would be a PR nightmare for any company to try to do something about it.  But if you perfer to be in an environment without children running around like it's recess; then you may want to give another location a try.  There's quite a few other Chipotles just a couple of miles away.  The saving grace is my love for Chipotle's food.  It's the one fast-food option my girlfriend and I regularly agree on when we're too lazy to cook and not in the mood to dine out.  Everything is fresh and tasty.  The extra charge for stuff like guacamole is annoying.  But Chipotle delivers great food at a good price; so I'm more than willing to put up with the headaches to get my delicious burrito.,XA-mMT47rFZNEllPBCYWQQ,"Here's a useful tip. Don't ever come here on a weekday around the noon hour. If you do; expect the following:  * No place to park. The place is besieged by Suburbans and Escalades....Notre Dame Prep seniors on their lunch period.....arrghh.  * One of those serpentine lines like at the airport; where you uncomfortably find yourself standing beside the same person each time the line moves up. Typically a high school senior looking at you; thinking...Jeez; I hope I never end up like that. {likely my ball cap; reading...This face seats five.....the sweats don't help much either)  * Indifferent servers; probably instructed to skinny-up the meat portions to anyone winking at them or making that hand gesture...the one with the thumb and forefinger signaling;...just a teensy bit more; please?  * And no place to sit. The seniors now in control; launching a full-scale assault on the table seating area.  Like a loser with a cute (to me; ewww to them) ball cap; you take your seat at one of the stools facing the parking lot...your backside to the seniors. This as you gaze out the window at the expensive cars piloted by teenagers; who; while walking by; not a fucking care in the world; look at you like you're a lone zoo exhibit or something.  I hope reincarnation exists.  I want to come back as one of these guys.  I wander. Sorry. The burrito bowl is my favorite. Here's a little secret. Refuse the rice and beans. When your bowl passes to the meat section. upon their seeing an empty bowl; the server will fill it to its gunwales with meat. Once the meat's safely on board; conveniently go \OOPS; I changed my mind...maybe I will have some rice and beans after all.\""  Works every time.

Friendly; outgoing; smiling and pleasant would best describe his demeanor.  FRED a fellow Midwestern took over this bad boy 1 month ago and certainly has enhanced its flavor.

My return visit came with some trepidation; of course. I heard Dan was no longer involved; and Dan was part of the experience.  The food should be the same; right? Same menu; same prices.

The meat was actually scattered around the quesadilla; with areas completely devoid of meat! And the cheese was spread extremely thin compared to the old quesadillas.  It's clear that what happened here is what is known as size inflation (as opposed to price inflation).  They raise the price by lowering the portions.

Carne asada is some of the best in the valley; fish tacos are phenomenal; and pastor and lengua were not disappointing.  The tortillas are the perfect weight and texture with just enough corn flavor.  We also tried the molote; a masa fritter with potato and chorizo; which was a crispy nugget of Mexican comfort food reminiscent of mashed potatoes if mashed potatoes got a stylish makeover that involved spice; black beans; and queso fresco wrapped in fried; corn-y goodness.

The emoloyee went over the menu and recommended we try the smokehouse beef and cheddar brisket.  The sub was delicious.  After leaving we couldn't stop talking about how good the sub was. In fact we went right back to firehouse subs a few days later.   So if your hungry for a good sub at a great price; head over to firehouse.,#NAME?,Mike C. joined me to whip into this place and try it today.  OMG what a great sandwich!  I went with a make-it-a-large Pastrami.  It was about a foot long & came loaded with pastrami; mayo; mustard; lettuce; tomato; onion & a dill spear on the side; on a very fresh; delicious honey wheat roll.  The staff was friendly; the place completely comfortable and I have just never had a better pastrami!  It was priced right too at $7.89 and I can't wait to return to a Firehouse & start biting my way through the rest of the subs on their menu.  It was special!     :-)),#NAME?,Really good sub and not bad on price.  So far; I like this place more than Jersey Mike and Jimmy Johns; the sandwich was good; lightly toasted; soft bread and yummy.    I'll be back soon...,#NAME?,Had a firehouse hero sandwich and it was quite delicious.  It was a very flavorful sandwich; the prices were reasonable; and the people there are friendly.,#NAME?,"So I was looking for a SUB on a Saturday for lunch; and I remember seeing Firehouse Subs because it was by the Sprouts grocery store that I go to.   I went to the website; and I decided to order online. I am glad I did because for some reason the Subs take  about 12-15 min to make. I understand they steam the meat; but still.  I thought that the online ordering process was a pretty cool feature. It had a lot of options to customize my sandwich. It definitely got me ready to have a SUB feast at Firehouse.  After checking out and spending almost $13 for a Large  (Steamer) SUB; and a sandwich plus a cookie. I was finally ready to pick up my order.  I decided to dine in to get the full experience. My order was ready when I got there; I got my soda; and used the Soda fountain to customize my soda which was cool.   The SUB was mediocre at best. Imagine a sub like Quiznos or Subway; but they \steam the meat.\""  That does not necessarily make it better though. They steam the meat so much that the meat was actually soggy; and the bread was meh. The cookie was a basic cookie; nothing special. The best part of the meal was actually the soda.  I would not recommend this place unless you want to pay high prices for a typical non gourmet franchise SUB.  The place looks and feels like Quiznos on roids; and with 5 people behind the counter it shouldn't take this long to make a SUB on average. I think that if you compare this to other sub franchises that it has an edge with all the cool hot sauces to choose from; and the Soda fountain that is not like anything else I have seen in a store like this; but the prices; wait times;  and mediocre SUBS hold this place back.""",#NAME?,"Hey; did you know this place was started by firemen? Well; if you didn't; you're an idiot; because it's plastered all over nearly everything.  My sandwich was decent. It wasn't horrible; but it wasn't good. Before I went; I wondered what their gimmick would be. Besides the firefighter thing; I mean. It turns out their gimmick is steaming their sandwich meat.  Now; I'm no expert; but in my experience with culinary parlance; \steaming\"" ranks somewhere below \""slow-roasted\""; \""braised\""; or \""thinly-sliced\"" and somewhere slightly above \""microwaved\"". I'm open-minded; though. I'd try this uniquely steamed meat. It turns out; I COULD tell the difference. The difference was the meat was warm and wet; almost like it had absorbed a bunch of vaporized air.  What makes Firehouse Subs stand out is their bread; which was really; really good. It was better than Jimmy John's bread; in fact. But between the steaming; the onslaught of fire-fighting paraphernalia; the longer wait; and the higher cost at Firehouse Subs; I'll take Jimmy John's every time. And it's only slightly farther away. I'm down with supporting heroes; but I'd also like to eat reasonably-priced; un-steamed sandwiches on occasion.""",#NAME?,"Hey; did you know this place was started by firemen?

People are knocking the place because they steam their meat instead roasting/braising it? C'mon. So you can't handle something different or what?  So for this review; I'm comparing it to Subway and Quiznos.  First off; Subway and Quiznos build the sub right there in front of you. At Firehouse; this is not so much the case - you order at the register and then the workers prepare it. For this reason; your sub will take slightly longer to make than either of those places and this is mainly because of how they cook the meat.  Now to the complainers saying that the meat is soggy or whatever; I've never had this experience. And; besides that; not all subs are cooked the same at Firehouse. Maybe before discarding the place; try more of the menu? That is just me though! I've tried many of the subs - Firehouse Meatball; New York Steamer; Italian; Club on a Sub; and the Smokehouse Beef & Cheddar Brisket. My favorites; in order; are Italian; Steamer; and Beef & Cheddar. On a slightly odd note; the Italian makes *great* leftovers if you can't finish it.  Nobody really seems to have mentioned this... but the soda machine is freaking awesome. I don't know how many flavors it has; but it is pretty much the craziest thing you will ever see. It has a touch screen where you scroll through and select your flavor. And when I say select your flavor I mean if you want a Lemonade.... do you want it to be lemonade; raspberry lemonade; lime lemonade; or strawberry lemonade. It is nearly the same for every beverage selection you make.  I definitely prefer Firehouse over Subway or Quiznos. Sure; they may be a little more pricey; but I still like it. I will have to check out Jimmy John's; which everyone seems to rave about to see what all the fuss is about and round out my review for all 4 places.,#NAME?,I want to like this place; I really do; but today's New York Steamer was probably a Top 10 disappointing sandwich of my life. Soggy; lifeless; unimaginative; and overpriced.   I'd been to Firehouse one previous time; and the meatball was better. Far from spectacular; but much more satisfying than the corned beef/pastrami number I ordered during Visit #2. It was steamed meat; cheese and mayo on an old-tasting white hoagie. No veggies; no color; no texture; no good.  The Firehouse concept and story are cool. The employees are nice. The fountain drink vending machine is second to none. And I enjoy being able to watch college hoops while my sandwich gets steamed to death. But these pros cannot save an underwhelming experience that cost me $9. Subway's $5 Cold Cut Combo would have been a better investment.,#NAME?,I want to like this place; I really do; but today's New York Steamer was probably a Top 10 disappointing sandwich of my life.

Seor Taco is a favorite of a friend of mine who has two children ages 9 and 12.  Seor Taco might not be one of my favorite eating establishments but the food at Seor Taco is reasonably priced and the serving sizes are very generous.   Seor Taco has a  small condiment bar. I really enjoy the salsa bar with all the different types of salsa's and hot carrots.  The  burrito  I ordered was good and as I mentioned; a very generous  serving size; large enough to take some home.   Seor Taco offers a variety of entr_es to order from and the customer service is second to none.  No pretense just come in; order; sit down and enjoy.,6SWknDhTfrw3NyywMCyZJg,I'm working out at Litchfield Park this month so I finally had a chance to try Senior Taco--a place that always seems packed at their Fountain Hills location the times I am up there.   This is sort of a Filiberto's-style place. It is fast food; it has a similar menu. The prices are similar. However; the food was quite different.   I tried three things; trying some of each and bringing some back to the office with me. First; the carne asada torta. I would say this is the most similar in flavor to Filibertos. Not bad; but not super great. It would have benefited from more meat and less guacamole. I also had a shredded beef; hard-shell taco. This was quite a bit different than Filiberto's and; in my opinion; better. They did not fry it as much; and it had a lot more cheese than I usually get at Filibertos. I also had the carne asada soft taco. The size was large and it was very good. Nothing here is super great; but the tacos were especially yummy.   Service; cleanliness and all of the rest were average or above for a fast food restaurant.   I give it 3.5 stars--leaning toward four due to the size of the dishes for the price.,6SWknDhTfrw3NyywMCyZJg,Every Friday night this is what we get at home!! HUGE California burrito for me and I LOVE IT!! Homemade tortillas; lots of food for an excellent price. I need my Senor Taco fix every week! YUM!! Great prices; lots of food... Mmmmm... I'm craving it now!,6SWknDhTfrw3NyywMCyZJg,I'll start this by saying I have been here on 4 separate occasions and every time I just get tacos.  No frills; no beans; rice; chips; etc.  I see those as pretty much just filler and I'd rather not.  So this is about their tacos... that being said I'd like to try their breakfast burrito sometime since its received such good reviews.   I have tried their carne asada; pollo; and fish tacos.  So far; my favorites are the steak and fish.  They are quite good; but I wouldn't say they're amazing.  They come double wrapped in corn tortillas (which I love) and a rather large helping of meat per taco.  I usually pound tacos like its my job but 2 is plenty for me here.  To me; on of the keys to a great taco is the cilantro; so I ask for extra and they heap it on!  The meat is pretty good; but I can see how some would call it bland.  It would be great if they spiced it on the grill.  The fish tacos are beer battered; but I have a feeling they are frozen.  So whatever; its a pretty good place for lunch; but I don't really want to try anything else on the menu as it looks pretty dang cheap.  Oh; and they do have a military discount; which is always a plus for me.  So; there you have it:  Good; but not great.  I've heard Don Pancho is the place to try.  Looking forward to my first taco there.  (Did I mention I love tacos?),6SWknDhTfrw3NyywMCyZJg,"3.5 stars.... maybe 4  Forget about any of the other fast food Mexican food joints.  The \Ricos\""; \""Bertos\""...  Taco Bell... etc.   This place produces really good fast food/ Mexican food. The beans are great!  The rice isn't bad and the burritos are huge!    We've eaten there twice and the first time around everything was a hit. No issues with the food or the service.  The second time around... the food was still pretty good. The grilled chicken nachos were pretty greasy. the chicken... although flavorful was fatty and this set the tone for the rest of the meal.  Wasn't horrible.. just could have been better.    Do drop in and give this place a try. It isn't expensive... and you better bring an appetite....as mentioned... the portions are huge.   We will go back. Hatch""",6SWknDhTfrw3NyywMCyZJg,Ordered take out from this place a few days ago. I had the beef enchilada; beef taco with rice and beans. My husband had the shrimp enchiladas with rice and beans. The beef enchilada meat was seasoned perfectly as were the refried beans. The beef taco meat however didnt seem to have any seasoning. The meat was good but just no flavor really. I would assume they would use the same seasoned shredded beef for the taco that they used on the enchilada but I guess not. Either way the food was very fresh and flavorful minus the beef in my taco. Prices were good for the amount of food you get. Service was a bit bla; but I was ordering take out anyways. Will definetly return to try out the rest of the menu.,6SWknDhTfrw3NyywMCyZJg,Quick and inexpensive.    Their fish tacos aren't something to right home about; but I highly recommend trying their shrimp tacos or machaca burro.   Staff is friendly and keeps the restaurant clean.,6SWknDhTfrw3NyywMCyZJg,Great food; great price.,6SWknDhTfrw3NyywMCyZJg,I have passed this little place by a million times on random trips to the grocery store. Today my husband and I finally popped in for a quick; cheap lunch. While we weren't expecting Frontera Grill; we were appalled with the MOLDY breading on the fish tacos. We brought it to the attention of the gal taking orders; and were offered a replacement (pass) but no refund. We won't be back.,6SWknDhTfrw3NyywMCyZJg,I'm going to weigh in here after eating on the other side of town at a more expensive restaurant. We love this place and eat here when we want Mexican.We should have come here tonight!  It is informal; fast food but the fish tacos are really good and the food comes ready for you to spice yourself over at the salsa bar (great idea!).

Buy surf and turf burrito.,6SWknDhTfrw3NyywMCyZJg,Mediocre food that took well over 30 minutes to get. I wasn't the only one that night. Most people left pretty pissed. Maybe it was an off night; but I felt like I've had way better food from Chipotle and some chain restaurants for the same price and in a reasonable time frame.  Skip this place and keep looking!,6SWknDhTfrw3NyywMCyZJg,def one of the most authentic fast food places around. service is always a 10/10 and the food is at least a 9.5/10 every single time. i have never had a bad experience in any way shape or form. prices are pretty reasonable. a little more than the filiberto type places but the quality is way above and beyond!!! be wary of the one on estrella and the one on mcdowell though.,6SWknDhTfrw3NyywMCyZJg,"Just not really impressed by this place...

(They're not in California; where I'm from.)  I ordered the Green Chili Double Cheeseburger Combo that is currently being advertised on TV; upgrading from a soda to a chocolate malt.  Here's how it went...  THE GOOD:  *  Nice dining room with comfortable booths.  *  Awesome service from the friendly and attentive staff!  *  They have MALTS!  Yeah malts!     :-))  *  The fries were ok.  = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =  THE NOT-SO-GOOD:  *  It was COLD in the dining room!  *  The heralded Green Chili Double Cheeseburger was a disappointment.

This burger was nowhere as good as a similarly priced one at either Smashburger or Five Guys; for example;or a Double Double at In-N-Out for much less.     :-O  *  The malt was ok; but not as good as the ones at Smashburger.  All in all?  3 Stars; barely.     :-|  Green Chili Double; Medium Fries; Small Chocolate Malt:  $8.14 + tax.,ixTr1qXUFGTzyaZUuCDDvg,I honestly used to love to eat here. Their breakfast items were good and at a reasonable price. But over the last 3 years; they have jacked their menu prices time; and time again. Now; it's getting to the point that they are pricing some people out of their restaurants. One example; 3 years ago; a simple biscuit and 4 oz gravy was $1.29-$1.39. As of this morning; that has increased to $2.04. That is a price increase of 70%. I know that costs have fluctuated up and down; but not by 70%. I feel that they are out of reality with their pricing. Too bad; because my office used to make food runs to the location @ 7th St / McDowell at least 2X a week. Not any more. My hopes is that they will reconsider some of their pricing policies. Would it not make more sense to make less profit per item; but possible increase the number of customers? I miss my biscuit and gravy. But If i'm going to spend $2 on it; I will go to Denny's and get it to go (I get an egg with it there..),ixTr1qXUFGTzyaZUuCDDvg,I honestly used to love to eat here.

Got the basic cheeseburger; it had two patties not sure if that was an accident. Burger was yummy. I ordered via the website and picked up in 7 minutes. They wait to cook your fries when u get there. Fries were also yummy and fresh. Fries also were a good serving size. I was not able to eat all of my fries ...but I would bet two to three people can feast on. I was surprised by how expensive a burger and fries was but I was satisfied by meal. Five guys is good but only slightly better than In-out. I think that for the price; I would go to  In-bf out over five guys.,v11wtoKy5sKLAdi8355MKA,Good burger. Got the basic cheeseburger; it had two patties not sure if that was an accident.

Though they do offer a few other menu choices.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  I had a burger (regular) and fries.  The regular burger was pretty good sized because they do TWO patties.  I like that.  Makes the price a little more palatable.  Burgers are fried on a griddle.  I really prefer my meats to be cooked over actual fire; but that's not an option here.  I went with it anyway.  It is cooked fresh when you order it; and you can get any combination of toppings you want (or none at all; if you prefer).  The burger was pretty good.  Not great; but pretty good.  The fries you can get one of two ways.  Either \plain\"" with just salt (like just about any other place would do) or with Cajun seasoning.  I opted for the latter; and they were really very tasty.  They post on a white board where their potatoes came from that day.  No way to verify if it's real or not; but it was an interesting thing for them to do.  They really do mound the fries up.  I ended up with more than I expected; which was a good thing!  While you wait they have a box of peanuts you can help yourself to.  I grabbed some.  They tasted old.  Not bad.  Just not really fresh.  I've been to other places that do this; and these definitely weren't as fresh as I would expect.  This wouldn't be my first choice for a burger; but they're pretty good.  I'd take Johnny Rockets over them because of their fabulous chocolate shake.  But if JR isn't nearby this place will do in a pinch.""",v11wtoKy5sKLAdi8355MKA,"I LOVE 5 guys burgers and fries!   Little (meaning 1 patty) bacon cheeseburger is the way to go! Their bacon is so crispy; just the way I like it! I get \everything\"" on it. This even includes grilled mushrooms and grilled onions. They carefully place each topping on and fold it in the foil with perfection.   The fries are good although not my favorite. I like that the post where their potatoes come from up on the white board each day. One regular size order feeds 3 people!!!   Peanuts to munch in while you wait. I love that.   They also have those awesome high-tech touch screen soda machines that are sweeping the nation!   Lacking that fifth star solely because of the price. For this family of 3; we spend no less than $25 in a single visit.""",v11wtoKy5sKLAdi8355MKA,I was introduced to five guys burgers during one of my many trips up to Chandler Blvd. The burgers come in two sizes; a double and a single. All of the toppings are free and the options are plentiful. The soda machines are the new touch screen type with lots of different flavors. The burgers are always juicy and delicious although I could stand for them to be a little bigger. The real reason why I will continue to return are the fries. OMG these are probably the best fries I've had since I had Thrasher's Fries on the boardwalk of Ocean City MD. If you put ketchup on these fries you are missing the point entirely. Vinegar is provided on the condiment table and takes the fries to the next level. As a word of advice; the small order of fries is more than enough for two people. Save your money and share a small order.   This brings me to the only real negative...the prices. I am aware that if you want a quality burger you will pay for it; but when my wife and I get a burger each; a small fry to share and two drinks and it comes to 20 dollars; something is wrong. I'm never full when I leave and it seems like I should be after spending 20 bucks for lunch.   Definitely worth checking out though if you're a burger/fries fan.,yZSxQT84u6CL_lmfHKMMNQ,I have frequented this Chipotle 3 or 4 times now as school is not too far away and Chipotle study breaks rock!   It is mostly your typical Chipotle. It is expensive and my biggest issue is that you have to micromanage the staff. They are more than willing to skimp you on the portions! Usually asking if you can have more works; but should you really have to do that when you're paying 10+ dollars for the meal??   The staff is adequate. They are not eager to be overly friendly or helpful; but they aren't rude either.   Overall; I go because I have a deep love fr Chipotle and it is the closest one to school. That being said; they could work in their staff attitude and the portions....    Oh yeah; and the guac is a awesome.,yZSxQT84u6CL_lmfHKMMNQ,I was so excited to see Chipotle in that spot many resturants have tried that location and nothing stays open. Not thinking this will either. The staff was unfriendly almost rude. They acted like they were being bothered to help and like you should know the menu by heart or something. The food was made so sloppy that my tacos has more sour cream on the outside of the shell than the inside. I only had to drive 2 blocks home and they were complety soggy; cold and gross. The taco meal which is 3 tacos; and a kids cheese crisp cost just short of 12 bucks. Way to much considering more that half of it went in the trash. Yuck; will never go back. And when I talked to my mom that lives near by about it she said the one time she went in will be the only time she ever goes either. Major disapointment.,yZSxQT84u6CL_lmfHKMMNQ,Love me them Steak burritos. Pricey but worth it,dec2TzjQ1skgmugHKJyLwQ,First time trying the restaurant. Went through the drive thru. Person taking order and collecting the money was very personable. Food was great for the price.   I even like how they ask if you want a placemat if you eat in the car.,dec2TzjQ1skgmugHKJyLwQ,Went on Saturday around noon.  They were slammed (drive thru and inside)!  Well run establishment!  Approx. 15 workers in back doing an outstanding job getting orders taken and served.  Happy workers!    With the limited menu it was easy and so fast!  Good food.  Fresh.  Thin meat. Peppers were pleasant surprise.  Nice.  Fair price.,dec2TzjQ1skgmugHKJyLwQ,"Finally made it around to this In-N-Out location for lunch today.  Of course the place was packed since I arrived at 12:20 but the ordering line moved along at good speed & friendly Anthony took my order.  After ordering; all the seating was taken at first; but soon a table came up a charged over to it; as did a couple visiting from Chicago.  We agreed to have lunch together & it was fun for all.     :-)  I got to share that an In-N-Out burger was the first thing I ever ate outside of my parents & relatives' houses.  It was Sept. 6; 1950; I was 3; & my dad had just surprised my Mom with a brand new Powder Blue '51 Chevy convertible for her Birthday; with the top down & a big red ribbon across the hood.  She dropped me into the passenger seat & off we whizzed down Baldwin Avenue & east on Highway 66 a bit to to In-N-Out in Baldwin Park; California.  (See photo.)  Amazingly; Highway 66 has fizzled down to being the service road for the 10 Freeway; but In-N-Out is still there; howbeit remodeled a bit (to speak in 1950 English).     :-))  I loved my first Cheeseburger (except for the onions...  Mom took them off.)  Also; amazingly; the food is still exactly the same as it was then; except that they have expanded the menu some to include the Double Double; and the \secret\"" items.     :-)  Today I had a Double Double Burger with everything & of course it was great; as was the generous serving of Fries; which I always order well done.  That way they're nice & crispy but retain the great potato-y taste that we get from In-N-Out fries because they don't blanch them!  They just put them through the slicer; right into the hot; fresh oil & cook them straight through until they're done.  No seasoning except a little fine salt to bring out the pure potato taste.  Yum!  Prices?  Still great!  Double Double $3.30; Fries $1.50.  5 Stars?  Of course!     :-))""",dec2TzjQ1skgmugHKJyLwQ,What's the big deal about this place?!? The burgers taste the same like any other burger joint. The Fries are nothing special either! The food is priced well but what's all the hype about?   Am I missing something here?  This is a normal burger joint and almost everyone is saying this is the best burger ever? Really?!?  Sorry; nothing special here.,dec2TzjQ1skgmugHKJyLwQ,Like all of the In n Outs: Friendly well trained staff. Clean for how busy they always are. Consistent. good; fresh; fast food at value prices. why would anyone eat at Micky Ds or the King?   I just wish they had some healthier options like chicken/vegi; but I guess they only do a few things; and do them well. It's better than a place with dozens of things on the menu all done badly.  Tip: Google their secret menu.,dec2TzjQ1skgmugHKJyLwQ,So there is only one thing that stops me from being a Vegan- Wait for it; Yelp; you guessed it- hamburgers. Ok; maybe not just one thing but burgers are certainly high up there on the list. Love me a good burger. Sorry cows. Yes I do love animals but my willpower fails me when it comes to a great juicy meat patty. But I digress. In regards to INOB Frankly; everyone raves about this place and I never got it. There are so many better hamburgers in town.  All the times I went here did not leave a memorable impression in my brain; good or bad. sooooooooo; when I saw they opened one more centrally located I decided to go again with the soul purpose of writing a review. (Hmmmm that's a switch for foodie Mary here who usually only goes to eat first and write second)     INOB is known for using real meat and not processed patty garbage- so give them a check on the positive. ( And they might be one of the few fast food restaurants that uses real food) In N Out is know for their wonderful hiring procedures and employee and employer relations. (gotta love that in today's day and age) - another check- INOB burgers cost under 5 bucks and a little bit over for a combo- WOWZA checkmate! (Mary does not like paying 10- 15 dollars for a good hamburger. She will; haha; but doesn't like to)     Ok; so now onto the negative-( Sigh; I know but I have to share)  Crazy busy places make me nervous and messes up the shopping center parking lot when I need to got to Michael's- check minus for almost getting hit five times getting there today.  French Fries-ewhhhhh! Why were they cold if they serve them fresh? I know I am very picky about temperature and fries.I don't eat fries to much anymore so I want them to be really good when I indulge because I hate to throw them out and waste food and money. They just aren't that good here- check minus.     And now onto the golden reason I liked today's visit the best----- It was the customer service!( big roar in the background inserted here)  Jeepers Kreepers INOB staff members can ya keep the smileage down please? Do you have to be so nice? LOL! I swear they send the staff to happy; friendly; excellent customer service college. They are all very nice and give service with a smile. Eye contact and everything. (Makes the longer wait a little but more manageable)  It is amazing how they beat out the others by a mile in this dept. Even better than some fancy restaurants.     So in conclusion; is INOB the best burger in town- no far from it. Is it good- yes. Is it the best burger for fast food under 15 bucks -HMMMMMMM; well you decide. I'll never tell. But to tell you my secret It is in my two top favorites. You will have to guess which one I like more. I do admit my favorite though comes nowhere close in the Customer Service dept and the Phoenix locations can't match the back east versions. So with that said many of my Westerner Peeps might end up picking INOB as their first choice. So; enjoy and be happy there is finally one more centrally located. And from the line out the door I think it is about time.   PS- you might want to tell them to hold the onions though. Wehhhh 6 hours later and my breath is still reliving the experience.,dec2TzjQ1skgmugHKJyLwQ,Ok; so far in my life and all of the burger joints I have been this was takes the cake. In and Out is a trifecta great taste; top of the line ingredients and amazing prices. When you walk in the door it is extremely clean and the staff are wearing the burger uniforms of olden days. Walking up to the counter you will find a menu with minimal choices but not bad choices. As you order you can visibly watch them fresh cut the fries and make your mouth watering burger. I lived in Arizona for two years and now the I'm back on the East Coast; I really wish we had them here!,dec2TzjQ1skgmugHKJyLwQ,"The food; really good; especially for the price. I noticed a few \yelpers\"" prefer McDonald's over this place. My only comment to them is that these same folks would probably eat dog crap if you put syrup on it and call it tasty.  Those people obviously have never had a good hamburger. McDonald's is the bottom of the barrel guys; IN-N-OUT is the creme de la creme. Anyway; I always order mine special; (no sauce; add mustard and extra mustard on the side). It's always correct. The only drawback is the parking lot and not enough tables inside the restaurant to comfortably seat everyone at the busy lunch time. (Saw some folks waiting to find a table and they ended up eating outside due to nowhere to sit inside). IN-N-OUT might want to make the restroom area smaller and increase the inside dining area. Other than that; the food was great and the price was more than reasonable. I also appreciated the good customer service. Very rare these days.""",-7smFzvh2E2fOOYs-0Dl8w,This is the closest location to me; generally not too busy; speed is good. Prices are fair; but for some reason it's always a struggle to get a fair portion of meat. I watch as the people before me get a decent scoop then when it gets to me it's like half the portion size. I am tired of always having to bring this to the attention of the line servers. It's good food and I will go there often but hopefully somebody reads this and can train their staff. I guarantee you their profit margin is high considering the ingredients used and mass productions. I just want a decent and fair portion of an ingredient,1_43FZHx3P5D7X-CpIR9WA,Decent overpriced commercial subs. Service is always friendly.,1_43FZHx3P5D7X-CpIR9WA,"I've been here a handful of times and I do enjoy it. Not as much as my mother does but I can eat it every once and awhile. I like getting the Club Sub the most but hold the mayo please.  The whole \Mike's Way\"" concept is nice but I think they put way too much vinegar and oil. I just always have to remind myself to say easy on the oil and vinegar please. The bread is also very tasty and I do like that they slice it in front of you! Very fresh :)  The pricing is...meh...I wish they were 3-4 dollars cheaper and I also wish they had COKE and not PEPSI products bleh!""",1_43FZHx3P5D7X-CpIR9WA,"Ahhh jersey mikes. Sounds kinda like a truckstop you avoid on a long road trip but let me tell you my friends...it's definitely a stop you should make. The BREAD: soft; flaky and fresh. The MEAT: sliced fresh for every sandwhich. The toppings...different and very good.  You can order your sub \mikes way\"" and it will come with lettuce; tomatoes; white onion & LOTS of (too much imo) oil and vinegar... as for the prices;  i think the people complaing about an 11.00 samdwhich are failing to mention;  that size sandwhich is literally 3 meals! I get the regular sub which is still huge & end up eating one half for lunch & the other for dinner. You can get the mini which is plenty of food for ME (probably not enough  if your a guy or have a hefty appetite ) for under 5 bucks. One thing that constantly keeps me coming back is the customer service. I would much rather spend my $ in a place that takes pride in it's customer service;  listens; and gives you what you asked for than any other mediocre serviced sub shop offering a 5.00 footlong and an attitude.  Oh and another brownie point mikes scored on the board? They have fox news on. That a boy!!""",1_43FZHx3P5D7X-CpIR9WA,The meats are sliced fresh for each sandwich.  The bread is fresh and very flavorful.  The price for the size is great!  I wish they had other sides other than chips.  And I have a card I get punched so every 10th sandwich is free.  I think Jersey Mike's blows Port of Subs out of the water!  Subway is average and very generic.,1_43FZHx3P5D7X-CpIR9WA,It is good food.  Sometimes a little expensive for what it is but pretty good.,1_43FZHx3P5D7X-CpIR9WA,Forget about other sub shops - Jersey Mike's is the BEST! They cut the meat and cheese fresh when you order your sub - everything is fresh and delicious every single time I go to Jersey Mike's! I read other reviews about it being expensive - here's the deal - you get what you pay for. Jersey Mike's has quality food and excellent service - well worth paying a little extra for! Tip: Get your sub and then let it sit in the fridge for a few hours - the flavors melt together and become even more amazing :),1_43FZHx3P5D7X-CpIR9WA,Good bread and meats. Staff was friendly. Little more expensive than subway or mr. Goodcents. But I enjoy it mikes way!,1_43FZHx3P5D7X-CpIR9WA,Excellent food at a good price. Went in not expecting much but the subs reminded me of philly sub shops back east. Everything was fresh and the store was spotless.,1_43FZHx3P5D7X-CpIR9WA,Very few chain fast and quick food eateries deserve my attention.  But; Jersey Mike's is the big time exception.  Their sub sandwiches are the best by far; even over mom and pop delis.  My wife and I have eaten at several of their locations throughout the Phoenix area and they are equally excellent.   The fresh sliced meats just seem to be the difference.  The prices are right and the restaurants are kept clean.  Highly recommended.,1_43FZHx3P5D7X-CpIR9WA,Good sub but on the expensive side. Also they don't have Fries!! And everytime someone orders a hot sub the entire staff yells HOT STUFF!  It's frickin Annoying! !!!!!!!!!! And serves no purpose! Quit it!,1_43FZHx3P5D7X-CpIR9WA,JERSEY MIKE'S IS EXPENSIVE FOR A SANDWICH SHOP! Just letting you know that right off the bat if you have yet to go there. Not quite sure what makes their ingredients so much different from the rest that's on planet Earth to warrant their pricing. But I digress. Beyond that the sub I had was very good. I tried the large chicken Parmesan (which will throw you back alittle over $11. That's just for the sandwich. So yeah; the people that work there probably have to work 2 hours to afford a sandwich there.) and I was not disappointed one bit. The only problem I had when I first got there was how to order. I thought it was like Subway so I was expecting them to ask me what I wanted on it while they were making it. But they just made it and wrapped it up without asking me what else I wanted on it. So word to the wise. Make sure u know exactly what you want on it the moment you order.,1_43FZHx3P5D7X-CpIR9WA,This location is great; best sub I've had yet. My roommate told me before how friendly the staff was. Not sure if it was the same guy; but very courteous and friendly. It's rare nowadays (in PHX at least) for restaurant employees to care enough to ask you how your day's been and make small talk with people. That always gets a tip out of me! Food is excellent and their roast beef is pink instead of nasty brown. I love that! I would love it even more if they would call it 'roast beast' (Grinch anyone?). Also; their bread is of the crusty variety; not soft like Subway. Sometimes I wonder if other reviewers think it's stale as they're basically comparing apples to oranges there. I didn't really pay attention to the prices because I had a coupon; but they send coupons in the mail all the time; so people should keep a lookout for those. Even though you can get a bigger sub elsewhere for cheaper; these subs are heartier and therefore way more filling. I can eat a footlong sub at Subway with little effort; a regular sub from Jersey Mike's; not as easy! That's a good thing!,1_43FZHx3P5D7X-CpIR9WA,This location is great; best sub I've had yet.

A little better than Subway but priced much higher.  But here's why they get 1 star: I paid $30 for 3 adults and a child; which is fine. A little high; but whatever. I didn't leave a tip because I didn't feel one was warranted.   The guy taking my payment (or another employee) obviously didn't agree because today; on my bank statement; there is an initial authorization for $30 and a final charge of $33. So they gave themselves a $3 tip without my authorization.  I sent a message through the site and have received no response. That was about 7 hours ago.,1_43FZHx3P5D7X-CpIR9WA,I love jersey mikes so much more than subway. I don't think I can ever eat subway again. The prices are a little higher but worth the money and you can add avocado to any sub with no extra cost.,1_43FZHx3P5D7X-CpIR9WA,I love jersey mikes so much more than subway.

She claimed it was the best sub she's ever had so I had to try it.  Unfortunately my sub came up short with lack of taste and toppings.  When we pulled up I noticed it was super busy and was thinking man they must have great subs for it to be so packed.  Was lucky to get a booth inside but it wasn't as clean as others have stated in other reviews.  I had to take one of their comment cards and wipe the table of all crumbs on the ground as others had obviously done from the looks of the floor.  I had the Chipotle Cheese Steak sub that I split with my husband.  The bread tasted ok; but it wasn't fresh out of the oven. They skimpt on the steak and hardly saw any onions at all on it.  For the price of the sandwich I really was expecting to get more.  The sauce was the best thing about it but I was wanting more of it as well.  I won't be going back.  Sad that it wasn't a better first impression.,1_43FZHx3P5D7X-CpIR9WA,This place was overpriced and not that good. The bread tasted old and stale; the meat was alright; there are just a lot better options if you want to spend $13 on a meal. The only reason I have two stars instead of one is because the workers were really nice and helpful; it's not their fault the sandwiches they're serving are not quality.,1_43FZHx3P5D7X-CpIR9WA,This place is just an over priced subway. 25.00 for two subs and drinks! Ahhh! GET REAL!!!,1_43FZHx3P5D7X-CpIR9WA,Awesome sandwiches. The quality is great and they are consistent. The staff is friendly and helpful. But they are expensive; very expensive.,3Q7vtF_cdHGyp2JOlKcu-Q,Still love this In-N-Out; & all of them!  Finally made it back here today; joined by Mike C. and Jackie R.  I went with a Double Double (Cheeseburger); a Fries (well done) and a Chocolate Shake.  All were just great; there wasn't much of a line to order at about 11 this morning; and we got comfortable indoor booth seating without waiting.  (Please refer to my previous Review below for more info.)  Todays prices were:  Double Double $3.35; Fries $1.60; Chocolate Shake $2.10=$7.05  ...an amazing lunch for the money; as always; at this terrific family owned non-franchise burger chain!     :-)),3Q7vtF_cdHGyp2JOlKcu-Q,Price was right. Cool concept but I like 5 guys better. What A Burger is my favorite burger; guess you could say I'm old school. In and out was busy and had good service but as for the burger's. A lot of hype.,3Q7vtF_cdHGyp2JOlKcu-Q,It's true : Having grown up in California; I love me some In-N-Out!  It's definitely over hyped; but the food is consistently delicious. They do the best job of lettuce wrapping burgers around; make that animal style with my fries done extra crispy.   They pay and treat their employees much better than their industry counterparts; which explains the fabulous customer service.   Haha; give me a break; it's almost non existent ... At least at this location recently.   Seeing as this In-N-Out is by my office; it's convenient and I used to come here often when I was a young; dumb fool that thought it was OK to go out for lunch daily. I never remember having problems with my food or the employees.   Dropped in here last Sunday to grab a #2 to go: Animal Style; Protein Style; Extra Crispy Fries.  Kayla the cashier was beyond rude and made it visibly known that taking my or anyone else's order was a complete inconvenience to her.   I asked twice to make sure she noted Protein Style. Dirty looks and a yes. Practically threw my card and receipt back at me.   When I looked at my receipt; I saw it wasn't listed. Kevin calls me up to grab my order; and I asked if this was done Protein Style. He said no but would happily remedy this.   Usually Four stars for the food. Four stars for Kevin; ZERO stars for Kayla.   I don't come here very much; but I will likely stick to the In-N-Out on Chandler and Price from here on out when I decide to indulge.  Sorry for the two star rating; In-N-Out; but maybe you should consider removing this superbrat from a customer facing position or not hiring these types all together.,3Q7vtF_cdHGyp2JOlKcu-Q,"Cheap; fast; great quality food. I'm from the east coast and never understood the in n out hype but now I can say I am officially a convert. I think my boyfriend saying \this tastes like a burger I would take off the grill at home\"" sums the food up perfectly. It's not your typical frozen; preservative laden piece of meat. On top of that; the fries are fresh cut daily and are delicious. Would eat this over the other big name fast food joints any day of the week.""",3Q7vtF_cdHGyp2JOlKcu-Q,Well what can I say but this place put every other burger joint to shame in terms of fast food. It's also extremely cheap for what you get so if you need fast food on a budget you want it to still taste good go here,18oecrR4bf-ctLvVGEaSLg,I admit it -- I had high expectations going to In-N-Out for the first time. I heard great things about their burgers; and I was hoping to get blown away. I was not. Now on the plus side; I love watching whole potatoes get smashed through the french fry press. That alone was worth the price of the meal. In fact; I'd love to get one of those for my house. But the burgers? Not so much. I ordered the double-double; and it was OK; but not really unique or outstanding in any way I could taste. For my money; a Big Mac is not something I can easily replicate at home (unlike the double-double); and the Burger King Whopper just tastes better. But that's just my two cents. I didn't hate it; but I certainly can live without it.,18oecrR4bf-ctLvVGEaSLg,"The first time I ate at In-N-Out was when the chain first popped up in the Phoenix area. I wasn't too impressed. I had a plain cheeseburger; and it seemed like just your typical fast food burger. This was before I knew about the now not-so-secret menu.   I went in again to try their burgers again; this time ordering a cheeseburger- animal style; with a Neapolitan shake. The burger had a soft bun to go with the grilled burger meat; melted cheese; crisp lettuce and fresh tomatoes. Animal style is the way to go; because of the extra depth of flavor from the mustard-grilled burger; extra pickles; and chopped caramelized onions. The extra thousand-island type sauce helps too.  Compared to other fast food chains; you get a really good value for your meal here. The extra ingredients for \animal style\"" don't cost any extra; and the burger meat tastes way better than something similar for the same price elsewhere. The veggies were very fresh; as opposed to the wilted veggies you find in some places from burgers sitting out on heat lamps for who knows how long.  The neopolitan shake was pretty tasty. It's another \""secret menu\"" item; and while I've never had a chocolate; strawberry; and vanilla shake all in one; this will not be my last!  I wasn't too impressed with the fries; despite being freshly cut and fried. They tasted a bit dry and crumbly.

I had a plain cheeseburger; and it seemed like just your typical fast food burger. This was before I knew about the now not-so-secret menu.   I went in again to try their burgers again; this time ordering a cheeseburger- animal style; with a Neapolitan shake. The burger had a soft bun to go with the grilled burger meat; melted cheese; crisp lettuce and fresh tomatoes. Animal style is the way to go; because of the extra depth of flavor from the mustard-grilled burger; extra pickles; and chopped caramelized onions. The extra thousand-island type sauce helps too.

You just can't forget the TASTE; these will call your name from your burger loving subconscious; saying \NOM ME\""; so taste is 5 Stars; ten even; no; A MEEEEELLION!  These PRICES are better than any fast food place for the quality of food your getting here; for example: The Buns have been Made just for  In-N-Out by Puritan Bakery; which has supplied these buns for In-N-Out Burger since the late 1950s; using only high quality all natural ingredients; They don't have preservatives and are used when fresh; just like everything else at  In-N-Out. This has got to be why it doesn't smell like a fat sweaty trucker (ahem MacDonalds) when you walk in the door; it actually smells like delicious appetizing food! So price and Quality are Tops.  The SERVICE is always atypically friendly; Its like they hire former Disney Characters; Im pretty sure they are like glowing sparkle Fairys or perhaps some other form of semi- Magical people. You just don't get 'tude here; ever. EVER. So staff is excellent.   CLEANLINESS is one of my hang ups; I can spot a speck of ketchup on a wall at 50 yards; or a dust fragment from space; But at this particular  In-N-Out Location; I know they have seriously high scrutiny for cleanliness. My last visit was just yesterday and they had a supervisor literally giving the wallpaper the ol' White Glove treatment; scouring the place for any specks of dirt; lifting up the fake plants and looking under the bins of salt & pepper packages; even searching the window shades for any sign of dirt. The folks behind the counter had White; clean aprons on and the whole place just gleamed with cleanliness. LOVE.   In-N-Out will you marry me?""",18oecrR4bf-ctLvVGEaSLg,So fast food restaurants aren't a big deal to me much anymore.  I mean; it's not the 90s.  I try to skip out on those as much as I can (well unless it's late night and that's all that's available; except the diners).  I did do a review for Wendys not too long ago and mostly gave it a 5 star because of the improvements.  So this is my 3rd fast food review.  You know sometimes we get a craving for a cheeseburger (even if it's overpriced).  So for myself; my go to places for fast food is probably this or Wendys.  So anyways; with this being probably around my 10th time coming here; I recently got the 4x4 (for the 2nd time).  The burgers really do never disappoint (for the price anyways)  It's a solid; tasty burger.  If you are really hungry; I don't think a double will cut it though.  They are just a tad bit small.  Maybe it's because I eat too much and been spoiled by other restaurants; but eating a double combo; I'm usually still hungry or hungry again 2-3 hours later.  If you are misreading the review; I'm not really bashing the prices.  Pretty moderate compared to other places  Overall; one of the better fast food chains and so far haven't disappointed,18oecrR4bf-ctLvVGEaSLg,Greatest burgers in the world!! Not expensive either. I could eat eat here everyday!,18oecrR4bf-ctLvVGEaSLg,This place gets it!! Where are you going to get a double double awesome burger and a nice sized strawberry shake for 5.50 !!! The combo meal with fries is 6.75..... Cheaper than McD's !! Great value to say the least. Rock on in and out!   Lol.....head over to 5 GUYS and pay almost 30.00 for two people to eat! WRONG!! My burger and fries at black angus was13.00 last week!! Geez! Go try fatburger and pay 10-15 per person !  crazy!,18oecrR4bf-ctLvVGEaSLg,Want a hot steamy fries and a great cheap burger come here!

Secret menu for regulars.,18oecrR4bf-ctLvVGEaSLg,The double combo was very tasty and inexpensive (less than #7). The people at the counter all had smiles on their faces and seemed to be very glad to work at In-N-Out; they apparently get very good training.

The menu at Chick-fil-A has a  wide variety of choices including healthy ones.  In addition; to the great selections from the menu you just can not beat the service.  The employees at Chick-fil-A are nicest folks around.  Attentive to your every whim; and eager to please.     If you decide not to dine in the drive thru provides quick and efficient service on the run and if you decide to dine in - the kids have a place to play while you can sit an relax.   All in all a good meal at reasonable price.,fVVpTBLOHZDH4AIACjO4kg,"Really disappointed. Me and my son went thru the drive thru at Dysart location here in West Phoenix; not five minutes from my house. It was about 9:20 or so and we must have gotten everyones leftovers that had been under the lamp for an hour. The waffle fries cold; hard and dry. The sandwich was cold and bread hard around edges. We hadn't gone in a while but my son said;\ this is not what I remember.\"" I tried calling and of course they were closed. My son had just gotten off off work and was hungry so he ate his two sandwiches and I lost my appetite; and am so upset I put my food in the bag and will wake up extra early tomorrow to take it back and speak to manager. If they want to leave early they shouldn't make a batch and let them sit there; close early. The last customer deserves  fresh food as the first customer of the day. I work hard for my money; I paid 18.00 for two #1 combos and extra sandwich; it's expensive but I used to think it was worth a treat once in a while. Think about it; if someone gets paid 9.00 and hour they had to work 2 hours tp pay for that; if they earn 18.00 it's still an hour of work to pay for your food; forget about minimum wage! Lets remember they are taking more taxes from our checks now; most people I know have lost 100.00 and more off each check. We deserve hot fresh food!!!""",fVVpTBLOHZDH4AIACjO4kg,pricey but good.  I have always really liked Chick-Fil-A; but don't eat there a whole lot because they are pricier than the other fast food options out there,fVVpTBLOHZDH4AIACjO4kg,Not such a fan of the chicken; but I do like the waffle fries. I don't like for the breading on my chicken to taste like honey mustard. Also pretty pricey compared to other fast food. The wifi at this location was decent; by wifi standards. Employees were all friendly; but I think next time I'll hit up the In and Out nearby instead.,SaIX7eay0vV-FxGPqTk1yA,$5 for a drink and original pollo bowl (rice; beans; chicken). Not a bad deal for a fast food place. It reminds me of a cheaper Chipotle. Definitely get the avocado salsa!,SaIX7eay0vV-FxGPqTk1yA,I feel that this is a mixture between like Taco Bell and Chipotle.

I am somewhat luke warm with regards to dark meat which they seem to promote.  The side dishes are good and they have free salsa in the condiment area.  Fries typically take a few more minutes to prepare.  Good overall.,SaIX7eay0vV-FxGPqTk1yA,What Happened to this place? High prices and bad food...,KXvkoGg5Od9Iwk4LMBFJ4w,Federico's is certainly good for a cheap Mexican place. I place it well above any of the 'bertos places I've tried. You get quite a bit of food for your money especially on Tuesdays; where some of the tacos and burritos are $1 or $2.  The Green Chili Burrito is my favorite item on the menu by far with the Carne Asada Fries following a close second. I wouldn't recommend getting the Green Chili burrito to go if you have more than a 4 or 5 minute drive home as the sauce will ultimately soak through and you'll be left with a fairly soggy (yet very tasty!) mess in your wrapper. Eat this quick for best results or be prepared to use a fork if you hit any red lights on the way home.  As Jon K. said below; the drive through is a nightmare. This is by far the most consistently slow drive through I've ever seen. If there are any other cars in the drive through; you should head inside and place your order.  This isn't meant to be an extremely fancy place. It's like a cleaner Filiberto's that smells a lot nicer and has much better food.,KXvkoGg5Od9Iwk4LMBFJ4w,we go to this place often only because it's right around the corner from where we live and the price is okay and you get a helluv a lot food.  we have never tried the drive thru.  we always dine in.  we have ordered different taco; burrito combos and some bean & fries dish.  not the best food but above average for mexican fast food.  the service is okay and at times they mess up your order.  we never had any complications with fixing our orders.  just sitting and waiting to get our new orders.  if you are not in shape and love fried food this is the place.,KXvkoGg5Od9Iwk4LMBFJ4w,Well; I've gone back to Federico's several times since my last review and they seem to have improved.  Thank God that RUDE lady doesn't appear to be working there anymore; that's a plus!  Service is much better and even though the Monday-thru-Wednesday price of the tacos has gone up from $0.99 to $1.25; I still gotta have 'em; they're too good!  The flavor of their red sauce has changed for the better; and I like it more than the green sauce now.  If I could knock 'em on anything; I'd say that the restaurant needs to invest in a good salad spinner because the lettuce is way too freakin wet.  I like that fresh lettuce on my tacos; but I've had to start ordering it on the side or forgoing it altogether.  I'd prefer that they just make it right.  I absolutely can't stand opening my box to find my once-crispy tacos swimming in water and sauce; and after reading these comments about their refusal to admit their mistakes; I just might have to take another break from them if the situation doesn't improve.,KXvkoGg5Od9Iwk4LMBFJ4w,"If I could; I'd give this place no stars.  NASTY; NASTY; NASTY.  I ordered a breakfast burrito with ONLY potatoes; eggs and cheese.  Simple enough right? I got home and opened it up to find half cooked potates; wet eggs; and barely any cheese.  Oh and they added ham to my order along with tomatoes and scallions.  I tried a bite and it was DISGUSTING.  I promptly threw the food in the trash.  Oh; and the price??  RIP OFF.  I can go to almost any \berto's\"" and get the same thing; done correctly;  for just under 4 bucks... they charged me over 5.  I will NEVER eat hear again.  Don't waste your money guys..... Taco Bell has better food. :(""",KXvkoGg5Od9Iwk4LMBFJ4w,Food is descent for the prices they started with. Now they overcharge. I recently ordered a carne asada burrito with beans and they charged me $7.14. My jaw dropped. They need to reevaluate their prices before they lose clientle.,X-dpycbo5fy8AyoHCUCryA,This place was a little confusing for me.  There were no descriptions of the food so I was flying blind when I ordered the California burger.  I just assumed it would have something like avocado or ranch or fish or sunshine or eddie money....but it didn't.  Nothing California about this burger other than that's probably where the lettuce came from.  Speaking of lettuce; this burger had it with some uncooked onions and a tomato.  These aren't normally things I want on my burger but; apparently; that's what constitutes a California burger.  It was more expensive than a regular burger because of the toppings.  Nice.  Since I failed to realize any of this at the time; I was still pretty hungry when I finished.  Since this is a steak-burger place; they like to flatten out the beef until it looks like the sole of your shoe.  It's pretty thin and not very filling.  The taste is good and it's not greasy (unlike Steakenburger) but I really wished I had ordered a double.    The fries were actually really good which made me really happy.  I ended up putting some on my burger just to try and give it some more substance.  Not bad.  Feels like I'm back in Pittsburgh.  Anyways; I probably wouldn't go back here but who knows?  It was better than Five Guys so they have that going for them.  It was a pretty ho-hum experience and that's probably what you'll get too.,X-dpycbo5fy8AyoHCUCryA,Freddy's is a good place to eat; when you hit them on the right night. We have been here 4 times in the past few months and it's either hit or miss. They always seem to pack the place; but that may be because of the price and the fact that we go on the weekend when there seems to be a car show taking place :)  Over all it's burgers and hot dogs. They are famous for their frozen custard which is awesome!  Last night the fries were very oily; I could actually see the wetness in them. They were good; but thinking about the oil was a tough one to swallow down.  I got a single burger plane with grilled onions last night; unfortunately not many onions :(  We will continue to go back; primarily because it's economical for a family of 4 and also the atmosphere is pretty neat.,X-dpycbo5fy8AyoHCUCryA,Great steakburgers!  Awesome flavor ! Much cheaper than 5 guys and their insane prices!,X-dpycbo5fy8AyoHCUCryA,Great steakburgers!  Awesome flavor ! Much cheaper than 5 guys and their insane prices!,X-dpycbo5fy8AyoHCUCryA,"Great service. However the food was such a bad deal I will never go back. Way over priced and the \custard\"" is not custard at all. If u want real custard then go to Ritas. Don't go here if you are hungry. I just was very disappointed.""",X-dpycbo5fy8AyoHCUCryA,Freddy's was a pretty decent place for burgers and fries; but they fell a little short of being great for me.  The burgers tasted high quality but they were severely lacking in seasoning.  I loaded it up with salt and a bit of pepper and things were made better.  The fries are shoestring fries so they're nice and crisp.  I really enjoyed them; but again; lacking in seasoning.  Their prices are fair; especially considering the stupid 5 Guys is pretty close to them.  Just to compare; I had a comparable burger here plus fries AND a drink; all for the price of a single patty burger at 5 Guys.  I probably won't come back here mostly just because there are so many other similar places and this just doesn't stand out.,X-dpycbo5fy8AyoHCUCryA,Tasty moist flavorful burgers.   Wonderful thin crispy fries with minimal grease.   We've been back several times and will keep returning.  Prices reasonable.   Fast service; order takers know contents of menu items.  Appreciate this knowledge with having food allergies. Employee even cleared table of tray and baskets; nice touch.  Deserts look great; need to go just for desert; portions have been so good I don't get desert.  The only thing I would change is soda choice; personally prefer Coke to Pepsi.,X-dpycbo5fy8AyoHCUCryA,Freddy's is not a restaurant for the health conscious; those with finicky tummies; or people who dab their pizza with napkins. Grease is ubiquitous at Freddy's; it's like a inescapable condiment. Hell; the soda is greasy.  If this bothers you; you may want to eat somewhere healthier. Like anywhere else in the world.   But; damn; these burgers are good. They fry them up on a griddle until they're just a bit crispy around the edges while still being juicy and tender in the middle. Your options are pretty limited; cheese or no cheese; one set of toppings or another. That's okay though. They do it all well. They have hot dogs as well; but I haven't really bothered with them. I can make my own hot dog. The fries are shoestring style; which seems to be popular these days; but I prefer a little thicker cut. Still good though; especially when topped with their 'special' salt.  Then there's the frozen custard... I was a bit skeptical; as I don't like most frozen yogurt; hate soft serve; and generally am unimpressed with ice cream. But this stuff was amazing. It is incredibly smooth and rich; with just a hint of egg underneath the vanilla or chocolate flavor. Really; really delicious. Like everything here; the prices on the frozen custard (FroCu?) are very decent. Honestly; it's about as good as Culver's or any other steakburger joint for the regular stuff; but the frozen custard really makes it stand out as a favorite.,X-dpycbo5fy8AyoHCUCryA,Hit this place as a back-up once when I was too late for Five Guys. Surprisingly good; and well priced. Love the really skinny fries. Custard is above average; but I'd go back anytime for the burgers.,X-dpycbo5fy8AyoHCUCryA,Good choice for an afternoon snack; just had the frozen custard; it hit the spot; and was just what we needed to pick us up.  Prices were reasonable and no one came make a Sunday the wrong way; right?  Not crowded; clean; good service.  Looking at the food coming out; might have to come back and try a burger!,X-dpycbo5fy8AyoHCUCryA,Their chili cheese fries are to die for!  Be sure to ask for a side if fry sauce to either drizzle over them or at least just dip the somewhat dry fries in at the end.  The burgers are tasty; but I'd prefer In n Out's small patty burgers over these especially for the cost.   What keeps me going back is the cleanliness of the restaurant. The friendliness of the staff; oh and did I mention the fry sauce?!?,X-dpycbo5fy8AyoHCUCryA,Flat patties; tasteless; expensive. I will never eat here again.,X-dpycbo5fy8AyoHCUCryA,"I am writing about the location on Williamsfield Rd; Gilbert.  The food and prices are so- so.  This last time we were there; I ordered chicken tenders (dry; overcooked and a very small portion at that) My fries were so salty I could hardly eat them \and I like salty fries\"".  My husband had their hot dog and it wasn't hot almost cool in the middle !!!  So not real sure what to make of it.  But to be fair; the service was GREAT the girl at the counter was very pleasant; and the ordered came correct...Just not real good.""",X-dpycbo5fy8AyoHCUCryA,Freddy's is totally grub. I'm down with the Double California Burger which is Freddy's take on an In & Out burger. I love how the meat hangs an inch out of the bun and the texture of the meat is so different from other burgers. The frozen custard is tasty and not that expensive. The kids and I get the dirt & worms and fight over the gummi worms. This place will satisfy the occasional greasy gut bomb craving. I'm looking forward to trying the Chicago dog and chili cheese fries.,X-dpycbo5fy8AyoHCUCryA,Great steakburger's and the best fries.     In my opinion their custard is the best.  Inexpensive and good staff.     Great to have them in the community.,X-dpycbo5fy8AyoHCUCryA,I went here with a friend last week for the first time. The employees are very friendly and kind. I was impressed with all the choices of flavors for the frozen custard. My friend ate dinner and I had dessert. Very delicious custard and not too expensive either. I'll be back- the food and service were wonderful!,X-dpycbo5fy8AyoHCUCryA,"Quality burger and fries; nothing mind blowing. The chili is really tasty but a little pricey for \fast food.\"" Bonus points for the fry sauce dispensers inside.""",K2_Hmmo5crTYWiT_1sWnfQ,Chipotle is probably my favorite fast foot chain. The food is always high quality even if it's obviously a lot higher in sodium and calories than they'd like to admit. Everything tastes good and fresh. If you go at a busy time; it also feels like the line always moves fast; too.   But there's too big things that keep me from giving it five stars. The first was raising their already high prices last year. I don't like that I can buy a Burrito at a sit-down restaurant for nearly the same price.  The other is how they charge you for everything.

I live in Old town Scottsdale so the location on Scottsdale road is where i always go. But; tonight i happened to be coming back from a friends house closer to this one. Since it was on the way i decided to stop here instead of waiting to be closer to home. MISTAKE. The woman who kept bouncing between the cashier and the food line was rude (btw; clearly the cashier girl didnt know what she was doing..but we'll get to that later). I asked her for a vegetarian salad with the rice on the side...she put it in a portion cup and i told her i was sorry and i prefer it to be placed in a bowl instead  ( i hate the rice all smashed) she proceeded to tell me it was an extra charge. (So to have my rice on the side costs more?! I told her the chipotle by my home never charged me and she said theres nothing she can do. Wow; great customer service. Then i ordered chips and salsa and was charged again for an extra.salsa. it took  while for the cashier girl to even get my order rung up correctly. For someone who eats chipotle sooo much;  you will NEVER see me again at this location. Rude.rude.rude.,K2_Hmmo5crTYWiT_1sWnfQ,I have to give them a 5 for their Guacamole and chips. I am just in love with it.  Everytime I go to the US; I have to go there. Cheap; super tasty and I love the salad bowl option they have (as I cannot eat wheat flour).

Just wish that we had it in Canada !!,K2_Hmmo5crTYWiT_1sWnfQ,Healthy; yummy; reasonable price. What's not to like. BTW; the margaritas are abfab too. Guacamole is not that watered down stuff; and all of the meats seem to be free of grizzle which requires labor to sort through the good; the bad; & the ugly. We eat out frequently and this place gets a visit from us at least twice a month.,K2_Hmmo5crTYWiT_1sWnfQ,"I never thought I'd be reviewing many chain restaurants; but this warrants a review.    I've always been pretty happy with Chipotle; you know what you're getting. Granted; the ones in CO give you a free drink with a student ID; and they don't seem to do that in NY; PA or AZ; but the food is always pretty much the same; the cashiers run smoothly; and the lines move quickly.  Here? Not so much. We waiting almost 25 minutes standing in line this Sunday; and got maybe half of the food I'm used to getting (I'm a vegetarian; a teaspoon of beans isn't going to give me much protein).  my partners food was the same way; and up and down the line we heard people asking \um; could you give a little more please\"" or \""I'd like a bit more than that; thanks.\""  Same price; less food = sad Shanna. I'm hoping this was a one time thing....I love their salad and their soft tacos; but it's not worth a line that long.""",Nc2TtVj6py6dHH_XdWAKRQ,"I guess I'll be the lone detractor of this overpriced dump. I travel through Casa Grande a couple of times a month; saw them building this place and then decided to try it - having no clue what kind of food they serve.  Well; it's  just another sub sandwich shop and a pathetic one at that.    You don't get to request whatever you want on your subs here; they give you whatever they are going to put on it; including slathering it with enough mayonnaise to make 5 sandwiches with and there is no option to have your sub toasted.  I ordered a Turkey sub and a medium - eegee I guess they call that drink  of which there are only 3 flavors available (from what I can see; it's a glorified shaved ice drink).  The manager was at the register and asked what kind of cheese I wanted on it.  I told him cheddar; not knowing and him not informing me that for a 12 inch sub; they are going to add another $1.05 to the price for cheese!  The cheese; btw; was gross.  Like that imitation stuff you get at a grocery store that comes in slices; nasty.    I got the sub and the drink - we're talking a 12 inch sub and a medium drink - and the bill was $11.10!! That's just plain outrageous! You don't even get a bag of chips with it for that much money; chips are extra!  The sub was perfectly bland; just another Jimmie Johns style sub excepting not as good as that (and I don't like Jimmie Johns).  After eating this thing and the drinking the drink; my stomach started getting upset.  After 15 minutes; I ended up having to pull the semi over on the side of the highway as I started feeling like I was going to throw up.  I think it was the gross amount of mayonnaise coupled with that nasty cheese that got me close to upchucking; but I'm not sure.  I had to sit there for 20 minutes before the feeling finally subsided and I could start driving again.    There was absolutely NOTHING special about this place OR it's food.  If you really want a sub and are in Casa Grande; Subway is just down the road; is 50 times better tasting and is MUCH cheaper.  Adding: the prevailing statement that this place is \cheap\"" is ridiculous.  If you just buy a sub and nothing else; then I guess it's cheap; but don't add the cheese!  If you want a meal; then you add the drink and the chips or fries and now you are in the \""moderate\"" range; of which this place is hardly worthy of the prices it's asking to sit down and have a meal. A 12 inch sub - Turkey is what I had - is $6.89; NOT including cheese; which for a foot long is $1.05 more.  Since everywhere else does NOT add for cheese; the price of that sub is actually $7.94.  This is a plain-Jane sub; nothing fancy at all.  Then add a medium drink; of which I had; which is if you get the eegee's; is $2.29; a medium soda is $1.89.  Note; there were no combos listed on the menu at all.  A small fries is $1.99; a  bag of chips is $1.29.  So; if you get their infamous \""eegee's\"" drink in medium size; a 12 inch sub and a bag of chips; you are at $13.22 for a meal without tax!  This is completely outrageous!!  You'll pay $5 less for a FAR superior sub combo at Subway.  That is the sticking point: This place does NOT have combo prices!  Referencing the review that says \""these people are clueless\""; referring to the Yelps! that are giving Eegee's a poor review; and since mine is the only poor review; let me just say this: it is obvious that most if not all of these other reviews are from people who grew up going to Eegee's.  This chain obviously has a sentimental value to them.  Mine is a  subjective review with no bias since I had never eaten before at this establishment and this was my first (and last) time ever eating there.  The food I ate there was bland; almost tasteless.  The price for a meal; since there are no combos listed on the menu; are outrageous for the food being served.  This is the plain facts.  The price tag definitely is NOT worth it for the food that is being served.  Additional edit: per the reviewer that thinks Subway is inferior to this place; please give me a break.  Subway is FAR superior to this place; in fact; just about any of the sub shops are way better.  Some of Subway's meats are of the \""processed\"" flavor but not all of them and I can stand there; watching them make the sandwich and tell them how much of this and that I want on it; which you definitely cannot do at Eegee's.  The Eegee's sub I had was the worst sub I have ever tasted; period.  I did like the Eegee's shaved ice drink; I'll give them kudos for that; it was good.""",Nc2TtVj6py6dHH_XdWAKRQ,"I guess I'll be the lone detractor of this overpriced dump. I travel through Casa Grande a couple of times a month; saw them building this place and then decided to try it - having no clue what kind of food they serve.  Well; it's  just another sub sandwich shop and a pathetic one at that.    You don't get to request whatever you want on your subs here; they give you whatever they are going to put on it; including slathering it with enough mayonnaise to make 5 sandwiches with and there is no option to have your sub toasted.  I ordered a Turkey sub and a medium - eegee I guess they call that drink  of which there are only 3 flavors available (from what I can see; it's a glorified shaved ice drink).  The manager was at the register and asked what kind of cheese I wanted on it.  I told him cheddar; not knowing and him not informing me that for a 12 inch sub; they are going to add another $1.05 to the price for cheese!  The cheese; btw; was gross.  Like that imitation stuff you get at a grocery store that comes in slices; nasty.    I got the sub and the drink - we're talking a 12 inch sub and a medium drink - and the bill was $11.10!! That's just plain outrageous! You don't even get a bag of chips with it for that much money; chips are extra!  The sub was perfectly bland; just another Jimmie Johns style sub excepting not as good as that (and I don't like Jimmie Johns).  After eating this thing and the drinking the drink; my stomach started getting upset.  After 15 minutes; I ended up having to pull the semi over on the side of the highway as I started feeling like I was going to throw up.  I think it was the gross amount of mayonnaise coupled with that nasty cheese that got me close to upchucking; but I'm not sure.  I had to sit there for 20 minutes before the feeling finally subsided and I could start driving again.    There was absolutely NOTHING special about this place OR it's food.

Cons Cold tortilla Cold and Flavorless barbacoa Beans tasted like plastic bottle caps Salsa had a weird taste    Pros The little red tray where they put your burrito on The guacamole   I know it's fast food but I just don't find what's so exciting about this place. There are better places here in the valley that serve delicious Mexican food for the same price.,xM5F0cLAlKWoB8rOgt5ZOw,I order take out from this location on a weekly basis; and I'm always so impressed with the friendly staff; the amazing fresh food; the super delicious chips and guacamole; and the prices! Great healthy food to go; you can't beat Chipotle! Keep up the great work guys!! See you this week.,xM5F0cLAlKWoB8rOgt5ZOw,"Love ... Love ... Love Chipotle!   This location is always consistent and have never messed up an order; even a phone in. The food is fresh; flavorful; and reasonably priced for the portions you get. You definitely want to come hungry! I always say; \I'll take some home.\"" It never happens!  My only negative has to do with parking. If you come at lunch or dinner the parking can be a bit of a pain; but I can't blame Chipotle for that one! That just means it's good food :-)  One of the staff members was great the other day... I didn't catch his name but he came around and asked us how the food was. Once he saw me eating the Guac he stopped back by to ask me if I had any pointers to make it better? Good guy and cares about the product he puts out for the customers.   I'll definitely be back!""",xM5F0cLAlKWoB8rOgt5ZOw,Chipotle is good; mostly organic Mexican fast food. I mainly eat here because it is cheap and healthier than most fast food. I usually get the burritos but they have tacos; quesadillas; and bowls. The attraction for me is the delicious meats. The barbacoa here made me fall in love with barbacoa because it is so flavorful. The steak and chicken is great too because they are usually locally raised and without hormones. I don't care for the carnitas (pork) here because it is too dry.  For toppings they have three types of salsa; corn; cheese; sour cream; lettuce; guacamole; white or brown rice; black beans; pinto beans and peppers and onions. The sour cream is way too watery for me and lacks flavor. They have chips; soft drinks and beer. That is pretty much their whole menu; but you tell them what to put on your burrito or bowl or whatever you are getting so you can change it up each visit.  One other downfall is that you don't get your tortillas browned on your burrito like you would at some other places that serve Mexican food. The barbacoa burrito I got tonight was $9.24 after tax because I got guacamole for $1.80 extra.  Overall; Chipotle is decent; but it is up to the customer to be creative and go against the norm if you want something like pollo asada then you would have to tell them to skip the rice and beans and just give you a ton of chicken; the green salsa; and guacamole. If you think like this you can stave off boredom for a while since they don't have some of the other things you would get at other Mexican places like fish or shrimp tacos; mexican rice; refried beans; chimichangas; taquitos; tortas; or tostadas.  Dear Chipotle corporate: If you are listening; I like your concept but more variety would be welcomed with open arms.  I realize that some of the items Chipotle doesn't make are not very healthy (like anything fried) but how easy would it be to make tortas or shrimp tacos?  Just saying...,XJc9Ueb3avGpYaj5Ll92hg,The posters lining the walls talking about how good this place is are mostly from the last decade; because all the cool new burger place are better without question. So what if the fries come in portions you struggle to finish on your own? They're not that good. There aren't many cool toppings to choose from. Ooh; American cheese...I'm enthralled...not.   The burger is just ok. Not seasoned; buns aren't really toasted...just really low-effort. I would compare the quality to that of a place with a drive-thru; but a meal costs nearly what you'd pay at a sit-down restaurant. This chain is overrated.,XJc9Ueb3avGpYaj5Ll92hg,"Try their \hot sauce\"" on your burger. Good!  This particular five guys is fairly new.  My family likes the fries when they're hot.  The burgers aren't cheap; but they are very good and the toppings selection is also very good.  The drink dispensers are a family favorite.  They love mixing flavors with their Sprite or Coke.  It's a God-awful dirty mess in there with Peanut shells and dirty tables everywhere as they try to keep up.  It's your typical 5 Guys.  if you like them; you won't be disappointed in this one.""",XJc9Ueb3avGpYaj5Ll92hg,This newest Five Guys opened up the street from my house about three months ago & I finally got around to giving it a try tonight.  I ordered their regular burger with raw onion; pickle; tomato; ketchup; mustard; green peppers; Jalepeo peppers & mushrooms.  My order was ready in a short little while; served up by the very friendly staff in a bright; clean; comfortable atmosphere; with cool oldies playing & free peanuts on the side.  YUM; YUM; YUM!!  IT WAS AN EASY 5 STARS FOR THIS BIG; AWESOME BURGER priced at $5.59.     :-)),XJc9Ueb3avGpYaj5Ll92hg,So my son and I decided we hadn't been to Five Guys in a long while - like over a year.  Went there tonight around 720pm and there were equal numbers of employees to customers - about 5 each.    Two burgers; one a double cheeseburger the other one a regular cheeseburger and one big order of fries.  Dropped $25 bucks.  Only one person ahead of us but took about 4-5 minutes for their order (for 2 people).  Even though the place was not busy - the employees seemed more interested interacting with each other than customers.  Got done ordering and was waiting.  Young lady came back into the place 2x's working to get her order correct...made my spidey sense go off.  We got our order to go and headed out  - didn't want to deconstruct and reconstruct the contents of the bag..  Got home and both burgers were doubles; and one of them didn't have onions (contrary to the order).    Mediocre at best but for a Scottsdale level price.   Oh well; I think the next period that we go dark for Five Guys will be much longer than the last.  Habit is very good alternative.,XJc9Ueb3avGpYaj5Ll92hg,"This chain sure is full of itself with signs everywhere declaring how their burgers were voted best of all-over-the-place. Fine; we get it; people voted for chains in their \best of\"" votes.  A sign for their potatoes too. They bought potatoes from a farm in Idaho; how bold of them.   A burger has two patties and a cheeseburger has two patties and some cheese.   Ridiculous amounts of fries. Extra fries help ensure we all stay fat. Thanks.  It's refreshing to tell someone what you want on your burger and they get it right.  7 minute parking for \""snappy\"" people. Sign is funny but 7 minutes doesn't seem like a realistic time since it probably takes that long for them to cook your burger.  $16 for fries; a cheeseburger and a hamburger. The quality is there in the beef but the bun sucks for that price. I want a kaiser roll or some sourdough punk!   Lot's of hype. No best of anything ever from me.""",XJc9Ueb3avGpYaj5Ll92hg,Great juicy burgers and amazing fries at a great value! Five Guys is the standard I set for any burger or fries I eat elsewhere. The staff is friendly and quick with your order. The place is clean; with lots of wooden tables for seating. There's also tables and umbrellas outside for additional seating. This store also has fancy Coke machines.   The food here is delicious and reasonably priced. I will definitely be back for more!,XJc9Ueb3avGpYaj5Ll92hg,"Decent burgers and a mountain of fresh and tasty fries...At a price....

Hubby loved that mushrooms and jalapenos on the regular burger don't cost extra.  The mini burger (or whatever it is called) is 1 patty while the regular sized burger is 2. 1 patty was plenty for both me and the hubby. The fry portions are GENEROUS. We went to order a large fry and the cashier taking our order kindly informed us that a large was sized to feed 4-5 people. The small portion of fries was plenty for the two of us.

The last 3 times I have been here the burritoistas FAIL at making a simple burrito. They do not seem to understand the proper portions in order to get everything rolled into a nice; appetizing  package-- instead I end up waiting forever while they take turns trying to roll ripped tortillas with bean water and sour cream leaking out of all its orifices. After some guy is literally manhandling the damn thing 20 different times re-wrapping in different tortillas and asking for assistance from every staff member there... I have a look of utter disgust seeing the insides ooze everywhere like vomit. It looks so unappetizing after they struggle and flail there arms trying to wrap this garbage (I've literally never seen so much over-exaggerated  shoulder gyrations since Richard Simmons Sweatin' to the Oldies)-- I'd rather have my money back.   Finally; some very sweet competent employee asks if I would like it remade..sorry I know there are starving people in the world; but yes please... I would love you to remake it so my burrito's insides do not resemble entrails. Thank you.  And to the rude cashier....get over yourself. I get that your job sucks; but the customer deserves a decent burrito when it costs $9.00. And oh yeah... I'm gonna take 2 bags whether you like it or not.,fE0zuDxZrJlQ7H91eY6UYA,I love this Chipotle location and I won't eat at any other. I actually have one really close to my house and their rice's usually hard so I just stopped going there. I also tried the one in Buckeye once and they gave me so little food; I had to and buy something else to eat when I was done. I know at some other location on the East side the staff makes you pick between rice OR beans; you can only get ONE salsa; etc. So that's annoying.  But this location's awesome!! We go here once a week. I wait and wait patiently until Friday (I could eat here every single day but that's the only day of the week I eat out and I MUST have Chipotle) and it's the happiest day of the week :)  I usually order online at like 8 am as soon as I get to work; (I'm telling ya; I wait patiently all week for my burrito bowl!) and when I get there at noon my food's ready. Sometimes I gotta wait in line because other customers get there before I do but I usually don't have to wait for my food to be ready (maybe it's because they've had my request for 4h but who cares? I really just wanna eat at that point :))  The manager already knows us and I can talk to him if something's not fine with my order. He actually stops by every Friday to make sure we're happy customers. I mean; how many fast food restaurant managers do this? I don't know any!  Their portions lately have been a little bit smaller than what I'm used to; specially when it comes to the amount of meat they serve so I'll keep an eye on that and talk to him if necessary and I'm also having to order extra rice because; well; it looks like they're serving less too.

Right next to my place in the Willo District. Can't beat the price; quality and consistency of chipotle. Located at a busy intersection this chipotle will be here to stay. I always go with the burrito bowl with the tortilla on the side. Chicken or steak you can't go wrong! I will be back.,fE0zuDxZrJlQ7H91eY6UYA,I love this place; its fast; cheapish; and damn good! Never had an issue with the staff or food! Excellent!,fE0zuDxZrJlQ7H91eY6UYA,I like this location because its right across from the valley metro stop at 1st and jefferson. I've stopped here to grab a quick bite before catching a departing flight out of town. The chipotle is located in a complex right across from the stop so its not far to lug my luggage. And typically i order the burrito bowl because its a quick assembly line creation so no waiting for them to cook my meal. And my reason for stopping here is to avoid the higher prices at the airport,fE0zuDxZrJlQ7H91eY6UYA,Giant burritos;  Uncomfortable chairs; limited hot sauce selection and  growing prices.  This review shouldn't be useful to most as if you have had chipotle one place you have had it everywhere. This is the latest location in down town phoenix; it is a popular lunch spot and not a bad option when you need a quick bite.  Their guise of healthy is tempted by the realty that a burrito can quickly soar past 1000 calories. It is nice that they have added brown rice as a option at no added cost.  I had the vegetarian fajita burrito 6.85 Brown rice; fajita veggies; black beans (the pinto are not veg) salsa cheese and don't forget the included guacamole at no extra charge.  Here is a great tip; before opening your burrito; give it a massage; mix up the inside so you don't end up with a bite of pure guacamole or rice.    Fir seats you get to choose from small hard wood seats with a back or small padded backless fixed bar stools; both say eat and leave ASAP.   Over all its something to eat that is not bad or to pricey and the location and addition of brown rice makes it a 4 star from what would be a 3 star chain.,fE0zuDxZrJlQ7H91eY6UYA,Giant burritos;  Uncomfortable chairs; limited hot sauce selection and  growing prices.

Friendly staff; fresh ingredients; and decent prices make this newest addition to downtown a good one to put into to-go lunch rotation.    Cityscape is poorly designed; in my opinion; but at least Chipotle received one of the best locations- highly visible from Washington Street.    They've recently added brown rice and it's just as tasty as their white rice.  I love that they offer so much variety; it helps when trying to keep your meal as healthy as possible.    Welcome to the neighborhood; Chipotle!,fE0zuDxZrJlQ7H91eY6UYA,This is one of the fastest Chipotles I've ever been to... And they better be; given how long the lunch line can get! Great food as all Chipotles put out for a reasonable price. Since they added the brown rice bowl it's quickly become my favorite for both flavor and the fact that it's healthier than white rice or a tortilla. Yum!,SM3EGMqG1MN1kYVGIXLx4Q,"Fast food rice bowls at a reasonable price.  There are limited options (Basically; choose chicken; beef; or short rib with or without veggies); but the food is fast; fresh; and flavorful.  You have the option of adding green onions to your meal; and there are \magic\"" sauces to the side to add to your bowl or plate.  The original \""magic\"" sauce is a teriyaki-like sauce which is nice in that it's not overly sweet like some sauces can get; and the \""magic hot sauce\"" is a Louisiana-style hot sauce.  The veggies are simply steamed; and the meat is grilled which gives it that nice slightly smoky flavor.  This is a good option for those that are looking for a quick meal that is healthier than most fast food places.""",SM3EGMqG1MN1kYVGIXLx4Q,"Expectations were low; I admit I was tempted to turn my nose up. I mean come on; it's an evil chain. Still; the food is decent and the prices are something to consider. I left satisfied and willing to admit I'd come back. I wouldn't describe it as \fabulous\"" like another reviewer; but it has a place in my book.""",SM3EGMqG1MN1kYVGIXLx4Q,This place is fabulous.

The place is small; clean; and basic; service is fast. Simple menu and tasty; healthy food at a good price.

Especially when you are looking for something sweet and salty and hot off the grill without all of the unnecessary calories?  Please; I'm saving those for the pork belly pastrami at Citizen Public House - I can't crush it at lunch.  A big ol' bowl of brown rice; toothsome chicken and beef; scallions; broccoli; cabbage and carrots and I'm in heaven.  You could get extra meat; but you'd be gilding the lily.  You could pile on the extra \special\"" sauce or the sriracha; but it's not necessary - the bowl is full of flavor and all for a song in terms of price.

Decent price.,SM3EGMqG1MN1kYVGIXLx4Q,"This small place is certainly tasty; I wanted to get a rice bowl for sure... I asked the lady at the counter what was the most popular dish if I'd never been here & she was very nice and helpful in helping us order. I got the Works Bowl which has beef and chicken along with veggies. You have a choice of white or brown rice and then green onions or not. The Brown rice is a bit extra; but what's healthier and cheaper? That doesn't exist. The \magic sauce\"" is delicious; even though it's just sweet teriyaki sauce. & they have the tea stand with 4 different types of Teas. My favorite! Look for coupons before you go in; great place to satisfy a rice fix and save a few bucks!""",SM3EGMqG1MN1kYVGIXLx4Q,It's quick; tasty; healthy and affordable what more do you really need to know?  Oh so you want to know about the food well it's pretty much rice and meat but done the right way. This is chicken or beef chopped up and put on top of either brown or white rice; I always go brown since it's better for you. The mixture is topped off with some magic sauce which is Korean BBQ sauce which is a lot like teriyaki sauce. You can also get veggies too but I rarely do.  I usually get the combo plate which adds a little salad with some tasty sesame dressing and an orange. I think the price is about $9 OTD and is enough food for at least one meal if not a meal and little snack later.  They also have a punch card program so you can earn free meals too.,SM3EGMqG1MN1kYVGIXLx4Q,Fast and tasty!!!  Really nice people and the food is amazing at a great price.  One bowl satisfied me for two meals!  Great environment if you choose to eat in and they are quick if you need a fast take-out lunch.,SM3EGMqG1MN1kYVGIXLx4Q,I love this place! Great prices and a healthier alternative.,Rr233WRnykn1j-qU9KOzCg,Pretty sure I dream about the Texas toast. They kind of have that In n Out vibe in that they only serve one thing; but they do it really really well. Service is fast and friendly. The chicken tenders are never dry. Portions are great. The prices are good; too- it costs me more to hit up Burger King for the same order; and obviously this place is much better than Burger King.,Rr233WRnykn1j-qU9KOzCg,Pretty sure I dream about the Texas toast.

I must say; I have been a BIG supporter of Chick-Fil-A over the years. However; Cane's chicken tenders/strips/what have you are outta this world! The portions are HUGE so the cost of under $10 for a meal like this is outrageously good. The sauce is better than any other specialty dipping sauce I have tried and the lemonade is simply the best. Even the Texas toast is the best I've ever had. It is fast food; but it doesn't truly feel like it. The staff at every Cane's I have gone to is friendly as well.  Can't wait to come back!,Rr233WRnykn1j-qU9KOzCg,If you want some of the best chicken tenders ever; come here!  Been here a few times and have gotten the tenders; fries; texas toast and lemonade.  The tenders are to die for!  Nicely breaded but not so breaded that it overpowers the chicken.  Tastes like real chicken; not any processed crap.  Nice and hot; great taste.  And the dipping sauce they give you is amazing!  That stuff is addicting.  The crinkle cut fries are nothing special but very solid.  Not bad by any means but just  nothing to write home about.  The texas toast doesn't look like anything special but its actually very good.  I'd recommend laying a tender on the toast and having an open-faced sandwich.  They say the lemonade is fresh squeezed; I didn't really believe it but I love a good lemonade so I ordered it even though it was an extra $.30.  OH MY GOD BEST 30 CENTS I HAVE EVER SPENT!  They are not lying when they say it is fresh squeezed.  Easily some of the best lemonade I have ever had.  The pricing is pretty decent for what you are getting.  Their 6 tender meal with 3 sides (fries; toast and cole slaw are advertised but you can substitute any of them for extra of something else.  I get either extra fries or toast in place of slaw); 2 sauces and a large drink is going to come out to around 8 or 9 bucks.  Could be a little cheaper for the amount you are getting but the quality of the food justifies it.  My only real complaint is that they need to give out more sauce!  If the worst thing about this place is they need to give out more of their fantastic sauce; I'd say it's a place worth trying.  Highly recommend!,Rr233WRnykn1j-qU9KOzCg,Its a knockoff of Zaxby's. Not that I'm mad or saying it a bad thing because Zaxby's is awesome! I've visited RC's University location several times; and no doubt will be back again.  RC's chicken tenders are excellent and their sauce is perfect for dipping. Crinkle cut fries are hot and taste fresh to order. The Box is a good amount of food and perfect if you are hungry for more than just a snack.   Anddddd they have sweet tea! :heart:   I thought the price for the amount of food was fair and service was friendly and fast!  They have a promotion that is a little annoying in that when Sun Devils win they tell you to come in for free chicken tenders but its basically a 'well played' marketing scam :P if it wasn't for their scummy ploy then I would gladly give 5 stars.,Rr233WRnykn1j-qU9KOzCg,"It's a chain; so if you've been to one all you need to know this is one is particularly clean and has great hours; but service can be slow when crowded.   If you are new to cane's the simple question to answer is can you eat chicken? No? Sorry; you're unlucky. Yes? Run; don't walk your way here! Chick-Fil-A can keep the chicken sandwich; these guys invented the chicken finger! Just get three things: chicken fingers; sweet tea; and sauce. The fries are ok; so is the toast; but really everything here is just filler. The sauce should be tested it's that addicting it's a little warm but not spicy and the sweet tea might be liquid sugar; but no part of your tongue will care. The chicken itself is juicy and will not last. Within minutes you will have a \i ate the bones\"" moment.  Faults? Price. After tax I spend around nine dollars which is a different tax bracket compared to most fast food; but it's a great occasional guilty pleasure.""",Rr233WRnykn1j-qU9KOzCg,If you are a chicken finger fanatic like I am; this place is heaven! Great price for the value! You have to try these chicken fingers with their famous Cane's sauce!,Rr233WRnykn1j-qU9KOzCg,"I've eaten at the ORIGINAL Raising Cane's on the campus at LSU-Baton Rouge. Granted; it was 15 years ago when I was still a student. I've also eaten at the one in my hometown of Covington; LA. But today was my first day eating at a Canes outside of Louisiana; and all I can say is that it was A LIL' TASTE OF HOME! I relished the Cane's chicken; perfect fry batter; Cane's sauce; slaw; and Barq's rootbeer. BTW; Barq's originated in Biloxi; MS; which is on the Gulf Coast. The Texas toast is perfect; but I've never cared for their crinkle fries. They're pretty cheap. They taste like the Walmart \True Value\"" brand of crinkle fries. No joke. Other than that; I highly recommend Cane's. If you only eat three things; eat this: Barq's Rootbeer; slaw; and a lot of chicken with Cane's sauce. Southern people know how to eat!""",Rr233WRnykn1j-qU9KOzCg,This place is delish! my co-workers and I come her often. I do wish the canes sauce didn't cost extra. The little container they give you for 4 chicken strips just isn't enough,Rr233WRnykn1j-qU9KOzCg,Tried Raising Cane's for the first time.  It wasn't bad.  It was flavorful but for the price it won't be my go to chicken place.  I prefer the other popular fried chicken place (from Louisiana).  I ordered the Caniac Combo with the 6 tenders.  The chicken is good.  The sauce is great.  It's just that 2 meals costs $18?  To me that is a little steep for fast food chicken.  The coleslaw was my least favorite.  The TexasTtoast was a nice compliment to the meal.  If I was with a group and they wanted Raising Cane's I would go back.,Rr233WRnykn1j-qU9KOzCg,Tried Raising Cane's for the first time.

They even got the Texas toast down to a perfection.  Came in here while trolling around Tempe and decided to give them a shout out. Located very close to ASU and should be a popular spot when you need to catch some bird.  Ordered the biggest thing on the menu called the Caniac Combo. Stopped drinking the dreaded soda pop and went with some dihydrogen monoxide. It is a lot better for you and the price of the combo goes down quite a bit.  The menu here is very simple and they give you a basic no thrills meal. You can always substitute some of the sides if you so desire. The big thing everyone cries about is the top secret sauce. Maybe I missed the boat on this one but it is nothing more than some doctored up mayonnaise.  Food is pretty good and the chicken is very tender. Good chance they are doing that southern trick of marinating it in some seasoned butter milk overnight. That always keeps it juicy and flavorful after frying.  Would like to see some more dipping sauces. Just take some regular Franks hot sauce and add equal parts of brown sugar and simmer it in a pan. Some country fried chicken gravy would be good also. Maybe just offer some jalapenos or something spicy to add a little kick.  Definity gets really busy around lunch time. Saw tons of sweaty blue collar workers (like me) coming in and chowing down on big plates of chicken. Some of them looked like they could have skipped the soda pop as well.  Recommend bringing your own dipping sauce or hot sauce to complete the occasion. Some people just need more options. CLUCK CLUCK A-OK!  3.25 STARS,Rr233WRnykn1j-qU9KOzCg,Been going to Cane's since I lived in Vegas. This place always delivers a solid meal at a reasonable price. It is like the perfect marriage of flavors in each bite with the slaw; bread and fingers. The chicken is even better back at the house heated to a crunchy level and dusted with your choice of spices. Of course; you also always need to buy an extra Cane's sauce; so your not skimping on your dipping. Great sweet tea too!,Rr233WRnykn1j-qU9KOzCg,I like this location and love the food. Only down side is it can get pricey and also being near the Arizona State University campus; it can get packed.   I do like that they have a Cane's Club card you can get by going on their website and filling out information. For doing so; you receive a free Chicken Box meal complete with drink; so that's incentive to go back for more and future visits.   I will be back for more visits in the future I'm sure; especially since I have a Cane's Card.,Rr233WRnykn1j-qU9KOzCg,The chicken and bread-delectable. The sauce- good; and the fries-meh. Good price and good customer service. Would go back next time I'm in the area.,Rr233WRnykn1j-qU9KOzCg,One of my favorite fast food places. Cane's started in Louisiana and they were everywhere in New Orleans. It is nice to see more popping up in the valley. They only focus on chicken and they know how to do chicken right. Sweet Tea is great! My personal favorite is the #1 no coleslaw extra toast; but you cant go wrong with anything on the menu. It is a little more expensive than some of the other fast food places; but the quality of food is worth it.,Rr233WRnykn1j-qU9KOzCg,There is no reason not to love this place.

Definitely would recommend to my friends and family.,Rr233WRnykn1j-qU9KOzCg,Decide to try this place and was a bit disappointed that  I waste my time and money on it. I thought it was going to be some spectacular food when it taste no different then chicken strips you would get at Sonic; McDonalds; etc.  Its way OVERPRICED. I wasnt happy that there was only one dipping sauce flavor. It was gross. We also ordered the sandwhich and wasnt too happy it had that sauce spread all over it.  I asked for larger Lemonade and was given a small size.   The coleslaw tasted funny so want fond of that. Only thing I ate was the texas toast and that was pretty weak too.,Rr233WRnykn1j-qU9KOzCg,This place is pretty cool! I like the actual restaurant. The decor is awesome and I like their disco ball! Good music for college students and perfect location for ASU students!  The food is delicious but would def not eat it regularly. Super greasy (would be great after a night on Mill tho). The chicken fingers were fresh and all white meat. Super crispy! And the sauce goes well with it. There is a copious amount of fries that went with the meal. Btw I ordered the Caniac. 6 chicken fingers; texas toast (which was bomb but also greasy) ; cole slaw; and a pile of fries. And a large drink.  when I say greasy though...its not swimming in oil. Just the right amount of grease i think. It could get salty but the coleslaw cuts the saltiness. Perfect balance.  Would definitely comeback! I wanna try their sandwiches!  The combo meal I got came out to 8.98... Kinda pricey but it fed me and my sister pretty well.   3.5 stars!!!!!,Rr233WRnykn1j-qU9KOzCg,Great chicken tenders.

Love it!,PNHXpLc799mkFipy5WlN6A,Pluses:  Service; priced well for what they are attempting (attempting being the key word) clean; fun atmosphere.  Minuses: I had the burger with A1.  It was smothered in A1 overpowering.  Made the bun super soggy.  Burgers are well done;  no other option.  Only American cheese no other cheese choice.  Really?  Fries were unevenly cooked.  Some were still white others crispy-very inconsistent.,PNHXpLc799mkFipy5WlN6A,Is it just me or have the prices recently gone up? Either way the food year seems good and affordable to me.  If you are going for a combo; the prices can get pretty high. But for 2 people; we just split a regular fry and skip the drinks and it really isn't any different than other fast food places. The fries are good. The burgers actually taste like meat.  My only complaint with the free peanuts is it seems like the turnover on them must be pretty slow. I get quite a few rancid peanuts. But those are only a free snack while waiting for my burger.,PNHXpLc799mkFipy5WlN6A,I am from the home of the original Five Guys burger joint in the Washington; DC area. Now they're all over the USA and I have never been to a Five Guys anywhere that was not the same burger and fries as I had the first time I ate one when I was in Junior High. It's always consistent and I think it's the best burger you can get for under $6 anywhere.  I love In N Out. I love Five Guys just a tiny bit more.   2 different experiences (no peanuts to enjoy while you wait at In N Out and not as clean at Five Guys) and Five Guys costs more; but one order of fries and a burger might convert you if you already have a favorite burger joint.,PNHXpLc799mkFipy5WlN6A,The fries are great they give you a ton. The burgers are alright; I like that they give you the topping at no extra charge; but they are pricey for a greasy burger joint. They are defiantly the place to go when you are hungry. If you are a tiny eater they are not you place. Free peanuts too.,PNHXpLc799mkFipy5WlN6A,Solid burgers and fries; and holy crap do they give you a lot. The cup they serve fries in is more like a suggestion; as they fill the bottom half of the bag with fries anyway. Why waste money on cups? Cajun fries are the bomb; especially if you like a little spice. The jalapenos here are pretty kickin' too.  Only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because of the price. I'd be here more often if it wasn't $10-$15 for one person. IMO a bit too high for what I'd consider a lunch spot; but you do get what you pay for; especially in this case.,PNHXpLc799mkFipy5WlN6A,Good burgers; but the prices seem to have gone up since the last time we were at one of these places. Two burgers and an order of fries to split seemed a bit steeper than I remembered. Even so; I still like the food; especially since they have malt vinegar freely available. Meaty burgers; not greasy ones; decent service and picking whatever toppings you want.,PNHXpLc799mkFipy5WlN6A,Of all the burger places in the area; this is my favorite. Love all the toppings and the freshness of the burger.  I know everyone raves about the fries & I have to agree. What's makes them taste so great is the freshness...their kind of old-fashioned in the way that they are like home made. They are amazing. I do think this place is a little pricey. 30bucks for burgers fries & drinks is a lot for 2 people.  But I guess that's how it is these days...at least it tastes great!  My only complaint about this location is the customer service.  They people aren't overly friendly or welcoming...they have a job to do & they do it. Nothing terrible or overly rude; but I like a smile with my meal.,lRew0HDz5BO-4fwWsMJyMg,Used to get straight up burritos. Know I am kinda on the burrito bowl path. With a little bag of chips and a cold drink you can't go wrong. Makes the dining experience especially for lunch a little pricey but hey. Its fresh Mex.,lRew0HDz5BO-4fwWsMJyMg,I LOVE Chipotles spices they use on their steak and chicken like you cannot believe. What I do not love about this particular establishment is that it seems like every time I go they forget to add a part of my order to the to go bag. It takes me a little while to get here b/c of all the stupid traffic lights from my office off of price and southern.  So it is annoying to get to the office finding out they are forgetting to put someones food that was paid for and having to go back to get it or salad dressing for the salad. Kinda stuff that is crucial.  So annoying.,lRew0HDz5BO-4fwWsMJyMg,Boy I'm a hog in heaven again now that I've found this place. These burritos with the tin foil wrap make for the easiest lunches that are nice and filling. They also serve tacos; bowls and salads; but who wants those? I'm sure they're good; just haven't had one yet. Carne Asada burrito with no beans; extra rice; salsa; sour cream and cheese rocks.   Be prepared for lines around lunch; but they move quick so don't be alarmed. Friendly service is always there; epically when they tell you guacamole costs extra (only downside.)  This location does seem more oriented toward the lunch crowd as I've seen them bring out extra people to speed things up unlike other locations.  Hope to see you there.,w7SrsFV4FL04bhQr-B6-4w,"This place came very highly recommended from several people.  My husband works in the area and was anxiously awaiting it's grand opening.  He found out the history of the place and the owner; and so we decided it was a place we'd go.  We finally made it there yesterday.  The place was clean and the people were friendly.    The menu is small; but I like that.  Too many options overwhelm me.  Hubby and I both ordered the meal that came with 4 chicken strips; fries; toast and coleslaw.  Our kids got the kids meal.    We paid nearly $28. This is more than I had expected; and more than I'd care to pay in the future.  For fast food; this is outrageous.    The chicken was good.  Not too flavorful; but the breading was perfect; not too much.  The fries were soggy and under done.  I could do better at home in my home fryer.  The toast was; well; toast.  Nothing special there.  And the coleslaw was same as store bought; I'd had better.  The \famed\"" Cane Sauce was ok.  It didn't blow my mind and it wasn't gross.  Ketchup was available; which was good since my kids thought the Cane sauce was \""weird\"".  Ranch would have been more their taste.  We may go back if there is a location that pops up closer to where we live; and if we were kid-less for the meal.  It's too expensive otherwise.""",w7SrsFV4FL04bhQr-B6-4w,"First visit to a Raising Canes..Mixed review here.  On the good side--chicken was fresh; juicy; hot; and flavorful. Fries were fresh from the fryer..  On the not so good side--Fries were the \old school\"" crinkle cut; processed fries you used to get 20+ years ago..Texas toast served with the meal was lightly toasted on one side only; and was not the least bit warm. Sauce served with fingers was a very \""different\"" flavor than the norm.. The cashier described it as a mix of ranch and honey mustard.. I didnt get any sweet or mustard out of it. More like a chilipowder ranch??? I would prefer a country gravy; a real honey mustard; or sweet and sour and/or bbq.  But the worst part; IMHO; was the little cup of coleslaw.. Totally devoid of flavor. It was like they mixed cabbage with watery mayonnaise.   My \""box combo\"" was 4 smallish fingers; some fries; the little cup of coleslaw;and a small soda..It was $7.00 with tax. I would've been ok with the price if the slaw had been decent; the toast had been toasted and warm; and if they had better/more choices for sauce.

I ordered the 3 piece chicken finger meal and it was good. The chicken is fried but greasy at all; on the inside the chicken is very moist and and tender not dry and overcooled like most chicken finger/ tenders.   The only downside the breading could use a little bit flavoring.  Overall the food was high quality and not to expensive; I would go back.,w7SrsFV4FL04bhQr-B6-4w,I LOVE this place and can't get enough of it!

Only drawback is it's a little more expensive price-wise for my liking but hey; it's an indulgence; or a treat; when I have it. Love their food; the ambience; and the friendly staff. Once when they forgot something to put my order they just moved me on back through the line so I could get my remaining parts to my order and get me off and running.   If you're looking for a new chicken place; give Raising Cane's a shot.,w7SrsFV4FL04bhQr-B6-4w,I LOVE this place and can't get enough of it!

If you're looking for a new chicken place; give Raising Cane's a shot.,w7SrsFV4FL04bhQr-B6-4w,"I was surprised by this place.  When I first seen it; I was thinking it was just another fast food joint. When I had gone in side. I was like; \whit is this; it just have chicken fingers? What gives.\"" Then I ordered and; Wow.\"" The food was great. And I can see why specialising in one foid type; really makes a difference. Service was good; inside was clean and well decorated.  Though the price is a bit high.""",w7SrsFV4FL04bhQr-B6-4w,So; after hearing a lot of really good things about Raising Cain's I decided to swing by for lunch today.  Unfortunately; I was pretty disappointed.   I'll go through piece by piece.  -The bread was pretty awful.  It was soggy and had a weird flavor to it.   -The fries were average at best.  Not terrible but nothing special either. -Cain's sauce is BLEH.  I tried their honey mustard as well and it wasn't very good; either. -The chicken was the only thing that was actually good.  The breading was very plain but the chicken itself was tasty and; as others have mentioned; actually tastes like real chicken. -There was a lot of food for the price; so that was good; too.  Overall it wasn't very good.  I won't be a repeat customer.,w7SrsFV4FL04bhQr-B6-4w,On the one hand; I don't think this place deserves the 2.5 star rating it currently holds but on the other; I can understand the disappointment..  We got the Box combo which is like 4 tenders; Texas toast; cole slaw; fries and drink.  I welcome this new kind of fast food restaurant in my neighborhood!  Its nice that you can get this kind of combo vs the traditional burger; fry; drink thing.  The prices are a tiny bit hefty - its just shy of Chipotle prices; I got this combo for roughly the price of a burrito.    That said; the tenders were pretty good!  Not overly breaded; fried right and not too greasy.  Not a huge fan of the Cane sauce - its not terrible but very negligible.  However; I do believe if you run a restaurant selling pretty much nothing but chicken tenders; you HAVE to offer more of a variety of sauces.  McDonald's offers 2 things - nuggets and tenders which comprise of what; 10% of the menu?  And they have like 10 sauces!  Anyway; more sauce options please!  The toast and the fries were slightly less done than I prefer.  The coleslaw was ok - not too exciting.  The service was GREAT; staff are pretty friendly - of course there were only 4 customers..  The atmosphere is fun and modern - random posters and pictures on the walls.  All in all; I'd like to see more sauces and a deeper fryer bath but I probably will get some more.  :),w7SrsFV4FL04bhQr-B6-4w,Went to Raising Canes today. First I have to say the place was clean and the staff was nice. I had  the Box which consisted of 4 chicken fingers; fries; coleslaw ;toast and drink. The chicken was hot and not too greasy and seemed pretty fresh; but bland bland and more bland !! The sauce was okay but no real spice or flavor; need more choices in sauces; fries soggy not fresh; frozen and not cooked well; coleslaw out of a box not fresh. In my opinion it was very expensive for the quality of food. Won't be back.,w7SrsFV4FL04bhQr-B6-4w,bland and overpriced.  For a place that specializes in strips; you'd think they would be better than KFC.....they are not.,w7SrsFV4FL04bhQr-B6-4w,Very glad Cane's made their way to Arizona...it was one thing I missed about living in Las Vegas! It's not close to home; but always worth the drive for fresh; hot and delicious food and great service. The staff is friendly; the restaurant is clean and it is cheap comfort food.,w7SrsFV4FL04bhQr-B6-4w,I have heard many positive things about this place so I finally had to go try it. I went with a coworker. I got the three finger combo. It came with three tenders; fries; Texas toast; and a drink. For the price; this is a great deal! The chicken and fries weren't greasy! That's really important. This location is sort of difficult to get to. There's plenty of seating and the girl that helped us was new; but very friendly. If I'm ever in the area again; I will be coming back.,w7SrsFV4FL04bhQr-B6-4w,"I had a late night craving for chicken and searched for a restaurant.  This was my first time at this diner. Both the parking lot and restaurant's interior were very clean.  I didn't check out the bathrooms. I was disappointed that this place only sells chicken fingers; very few sides and NO desserts.  .  what few choices were left; were also pricey.  I ordered the sandwich for my daughter and 3 chicken finger combo for myself.  While the chicken tasted like \real\"" chicken; it lacked the seasoning I'm used to and had more breading than meat for me.  The cole slaw was kinda off; but the fries were on da money.    Nevertheless; I won't be eating here again; as I was looking for chicken pieces not tenders.""",CQDxI8giIc6Kg9hQFLC6Uw,This place is great; not cheap; but very tasty! Not at all like subway - ingredients are fresh and their hot sandwiches are the best!  My only complaint is the wait... if you plan on stopping by on your lunch hour be prepared to wait; and wait; and wait. The place is crowded and the line does not move very quickly. I went in to pick up a large phone order; figured I could walk up to the register; pay; and get out of there. My food was bagged up and ready to go; but I was told to get in line. I was there for 25 minutes!!!!! Needless to say; most of the sandwiches got soggy...  I've been here several times since this incident; and love it - like I said before; the food is great but the wait sucks :),CQDxI8giIc6Kg9hQFLC6Uw,"We liked it! Friendly staff; extremely clean facility; nice prices and great quality of ingredients. On weekends they have a special; 2 regular subs; 2 chips; and 2 drinks for $12.99. They have a handful of toppings to choose from...I really wished they had black olives but they do have pickles! Also if you get it \Mikes Way\""; which is vinegar; oil; and spices; you should know they really pour on the vinegar. I prefer alot of vinegar so I like it but those of you who dont may need to let them know to go light on the vinegar. So if you're looking for some yummy subs give them a try!""",CQDxI8giIc6Kg9hQFLC6Uw,A little pricey and the service was not very fast but the red pepper relish is a real treat. Mostly sweat with a tart kick.,CQDxI8giIc6Kg9hQFLC6Uw,I've eaten at Jersey Mikes Subs a few times... usually this location and I always find the subs lacking flavor. On top of that the prices are more expensive than Jimmy Johns; and I think JJs has better subs all around.,CQDxI8giIc6Kg9hQFLC6Uw,I've eaten at Jersey Mikes Subs a few times... usually this location and I always find the subs lacking flavor.

However; this sub shop is inconsistent and the subs I bought today were not Jersey Mike's Subs. I had the number 9 (which I've had for years) and was stunned when she put ONE slice of roast beef on the sub. If I want a sub that has one row of meat on it I will go to subway...much much cheaper. And to boot...$27 for that and two other subs that the bread tasted like it just came out of a factory...nah...you lost a customer today and one of your biggest fans.,CQDxI8giIc6Kg9hQFLC6Uw,"Met up with friends here for lunch.  They handled the lunch rush pretty well but nothing outstanding or unique.  I got an Italian on wheat bread.  The bread was soft and yummy; the very limited(variety-wise) toppings were fresh; but the sandwich seemed scant on the meats.  They were generous with the tomatoes and lettuce but the sandwich was still 80% bread.  I had it \Mike's way\""; which also included what seemed like a pint of oil and vinegar on each side.  The last few bites of my sandwich were soggy-yuck!  Price is high for what you get.  Easy parking and average service.  I'm still looking for a sandwich place with the quickness of Subway but the deliciousness of Cheba Hut.""",CQDxI8giIc6Kg9hQFLC6Uw,Yawn.  This is your basic Subway/Port-o-Subs clone; and that's not a very flattering comparison.  The sandwiches are grossly overpriced; lacking reasonable quantities of meat and cheese (while providing plenty of cheaper greenery to fluff the thing out; a la Subway); and completely run-of-the-mill.  If they would use more meat and charge less; then the place would be OK.  The ingredients themselves seem to be of fairly good quality.  But to overpay for a huge chunk of bread with not enough meat guarantees to keep me away from this joint.,CQDxI8giIc6Kg9hQFLC6Uw,Yawn.

The joint was busy - surely a good sign.  And my main previous gripe was addressed - they were putting quite adequate quantities of meat on all of the sandwiches I watched being made; mine included.  I had ham; pepperoni & provolone on a white roll.  The ham was excellent.  FAR better overall impression than my previous visits here.  Still expensive; but with more meat this time; not unreasonable.  I dare say I'm now a fan and will be back.. we'll see if this was a fluke or perhaps my past visits were.,CQDxI8giIc6Kg9hQFLC6Uw,"Couple of harsh reviews but I've been nothing but happy with Jersey Mike's.  I've never seen or heard of other locations but this one opened down the road and after trying it out; I've returned about 15 times now and will continue to do so.  It's NOT like subway at all actually...  I have always had great sandwiches from here and have always had a lot of meat stuffed in; to the point to where a big sandwich basically makes 2 meals for me.  The stuff is always fresh and tastes super good so; no problems there.  I will give a word to the wise tho... Although it's very good... \Mikes Way\"" has them put a bunch of oil & vinegar on and if you plan on keeping half for dinner or next day be careful w/ mikes way as it'll saturate the bread over time.  Mikes Way eaten right away is the bomb tho... loves it.  Just heads up.  I will say they do take some time to make the food; and lunch time can get pretty busy and lengthy so they'll want to work on that.  But they slice the meat for every sandwich and it seems that may be part of the backup.  I've gone in there at night to pickup food on the way home and it didn't seem to take as long.  Pricey?  Eh... I'm not saying that... I think they're very competitive and I've never thought that the times I've been there.  Not as much as Capriotti's but not as cheap as Subway... but subway sucks so lol...   Good small patio for nice days to eat outside... good amount of inside seating but again gets busy at lunch (cause it's good) and the one downside is they only have Pepsi products.... fail...

I was expecting a sub shop somewhat along the lines of one of their competitors in terms of price and taste. Unfortunately; neither price or taste compared to any of their competitors.  I waited 15+ minutes (I'll be a little lenient because it was lunch time); but the way the line grew; I was expecting something more since it seemed like a popular place to be. There were at least 20 customers in line and only 3 - 4 people working; at most... The guy who assembled the sandwiches needed a helper because it took him for-ev-er to get all the junk on the sandwich. But; I only gripe because I am very impatient. Especially during my lunch hour at work.  The price was ridiculous... $10 for a regular sub; chips and small drink. I ordered the club \Mike's Way\"" and took it back to work to eat. I got to work to try and eat the sub; which was a 5 minute drive away; and part of the sub was soggy from all the vinegar/oil that was on there. The other part of the bread was a little tough. The flavor? What flavor? It had bacon on it for God's sakes! It should have tasted like SOMETHING... nada... I mainly tasted the mound of vinegar that was on the thing.   Needless to say; I didn't feel this place will be worth a second visit.""",CQDxI8giIc6Kg9hQFLC6Uw,This place has gone way down hill since it opened.  It has always been expensive but we still went there because the quality of the meat and bread were very good. They definitely seem to use better luncheon meat than most sandwich shops. When we first started going there we loved it except for the high prices; but now it is just a VERY poorly run restaurant with very low standards; poorly made sandwiches; and questionable hygiene. I know the management is terrible because the problems are so obvious and easy to fix but it just gets worse and worse. I have also talked to them on a number of occasions but they seem oblivious.  The first problem I noticed; a long time ago when the sandwiches were still good; was with the lettuce that they use. This one is really hard to understand. They have the worst lettuce I have seen anywhere. Why is it so difficult to have some decent lettuce? I had to start taking it off or not having it put on in the first place. The next problem that came up with the food was the bread that had previously been good; was now almost always stale; or at least nowhere as fresh as it had been before. On the last sandwich I had there the bread literally broke up into sawdust like crumbs. The problem here is no mystery and reflects very poorly on the management and employees. They now leave their bread out on the counter and exposed to open air all day! How can you be in this business and not understand bread goes stale quickly when left out in the open?  The service tends to be very poor; but to be fair; that's not exactly a rare occurrence in the food industry.  Finally; and this one may just be me because it doesn't seem like people are too concerned with this in restaurants anymore; the hygiene practices have become increasingly disturbing. Often I see the person cutting the meat not caring at all that the slicer is a mess. I worked in a deli when I was younger and I know it is no big deal to keep the slicer clean. The slicer is often just smeared with residue buildup from heavy use and they won't even take the time to clean it. The mess directly under the cutting blade gets bad enough that it will make you nauseous just looking at it. In addition to this there are a couple of other issues with hygiene. When they make the sandwich a lot of the employees have a habit of pressing your sandwich into the counter top and just sliding it to the right to the next stage of preparation instead of picking it up which should be no big deal. It's almost like they are cleaning the counter top with the bottom of your sandwich. The last thing I will say about this really bothers me. For some reason a lot of the employees actually remove the loose food debris that collects on the counter while making the sandwich; by using the sandwich cutter to push it into your sandwich after it is done. I really don't appreciate them cleaning the counter by using my sandwich as a garbage can for the scraps! Just put it into the garbage. I know a lot of people will say that it's just from making your sandwich but that is often not the case because they often scoop debris from other sandwiches that's been sitting there for a while into your sandwich. How does a manager see these kinds of thing and not do something about it?  It's sad because with some easy to make changes you have a good sandwich shop; but I guess they have a good location and don't feel they have to care about such things as long as people keep coming in.,CQDxI8giIc6Kg9hQFLC6Uw,This place has gone way down hill since it opened.

As anxious as I was; I was STUNNED by the sky-high prices for what you get.  I mean; how good can a sandwich be to command 30% over market value; and 30% under volume consumed?    The bun was 70% of the presentation; and although the buns are worthy and important; they should be 20%.  The meat and cheese should be at least 50% of the value for the sandwich.  Any good consumer knows that.  Here we go; with no need to elaborate---  The outcome of the big 3:  Service:   This part was average; and it's what you would expect at a busy sandwich shop.  We were 3rd in line; and it was 7 minutes before we walked out the door.  Taste:  I liked the taste; although I was expecting SO MUCH MORE because of the hype that they put into their t.v. commercials.  After hearing the commercial; I expected them to be the most-perfect sub; just like they said.  The bun is 70% of the sub; and while soft and tasty; should've been 20% of the sub.    It was just O.K.; and it's fine for a quick bite at a sub shop.  Don't expect the meat and cheese to overpower the taste; since it's such a meager and marginal portion of the entire sub.  Price:  Welcome to the 'horrendous part' of the entire ordeal.  I have no problem paying $5 for a delicious sub.  One of the market leaders has been doing $5 subs for years; and I've often wondered why any other competitors that want to be market leaders haven't driven the price down AT ALL.  I expect that they don't want to compete in an American workplace; that is expected to be DRIVEN BY PRICE.  I would even give $10 for the most fantastic sub; like the ones that New Yorkers RAVE about the subs in New York.  Since this is a New Jersey import; I have HUGE problems paying $9 to walk out with an average sub + fixin's.  I'd have no problem unless; of course; Chandler had a average; upper-class wage compared to New Jersey's upper-class wage.  You'll notice that they are NOT the same; and you'll find that they are VASTLY different.  If this sub would've 'rocked my world'; then it's totally worth a $10 fee to escape with their fixin's.  As it was; I was left with a sub-standard sub (less than 12\) and with normal; wholesome; expected; and anti-climatic fixin's.  A big let-down from what their commercials INSIST are the best.  Summary: This shop is overpriced; and they don't get it.  They EXPECT that this is what you SHOULD pay for a 'premium' sub.  The trouble is; that Chandler is NOT Scottsdale; New York; nor New Jersey; and they haven't factored in the DESIRED sub shop that should be operating in a college community.  (we don't need more Scottsdale-type pricing; just college-kid pricing with college-kid type portions).    I doubt that the owners will agree; and also; please expect that the owners will maintain that they are \""...doing a good thing...\"" for the residents of the area.  Please disregard their fantasy leanings; since they don't understand the undergraduate population.  As far as stereotypes coming out of New Jersey; I'm also sure that these owners; just like the aggressive; post-WW2 unions; would ACTIVELY seek to prevent you from hearing what I've said about their food in this article.  I'm also convinced that they would also ADAMANTLY deny any affiliation with union henchmen.  Viva la America!""",iKXnctUJOVxenM42ERcekg,Firehouse Subs is as good as a chain sub shop can be for kids. It's not just the four Kids' Combos (meatball; turkey & provolone; ham & provolone; grilled cheddar cheese) priced at just $3.99. It's that they include a drink; dessert AND FIRE HAT!!!   First ate at a Firehouse Subs several years ago while visiting Durham; North Carolina. I had never heard of Firehouse and loved the hot subs and the vast array of sauces they had on hand. Believe it or not; Firehouse was the first restaurant in which I ever had Sriracha sauce!  So happy to see that Firehouse's rapid expansion has not undermined their appeal. The employees at this location are fast and friendly. Even gladly changed a television channel for us.,iKXnctUJOVxenM42ERcekg,For what people say about this place; I just don't see it.  I tried it and will not be back.  Too expensive for what is offered.  The wait is way too long and it didn't taste that great.  I would pick subway every day over this place.,iKXnctUJOVxenM42ERcekg,First off; since it is new; it wasn't in google maps yet.  That made it difficult to find when I couldn't remember where I had seen it before.  When I finally happened upon it; I was a little confused as to how exactly you order your sandwich.  My wife wanted an Italian; so that was easy enough; but I wanted a roast beef with cheese; lettuce; pickle; mayo; mustard.  As I told this to the order taker; I was a little dumbfounded that she just hit one button and looked like she was waiting for me to finish talking.  The cola machine was really nice; but there was only one; so it was a good 3-5 minute wait to pour a soft drink.  People just don't know how to use the touch screens efficiently yet.  When our subs came up I found out that they just put everything on mine (including tomato and onion which I can't stand); but I headed home with them anyway.  Come to find out that not only did my sandwich come out different than expected; my wife's had Mayo on it (which was not on the list of ingredients; was supposed to have Italian Dressing; not Mayo).  This was a problem since my wife doesn't like mayo or mustard.  I ordered the large sandwich; which was less substantial than a foot long at subway or sandwich from Jersey Mikes.  I was expecting it to be big enough to eat half now and the other later; but it was small enough to eat in one sitting.  Overall; it was a nice place and a unique concept; but very sub-par execution.  Some of the bugs will work themselves out; but the other flaws are probably permanent; so for about the same price I would prefer Jersey Mikes; Potbelly; Jimmy-John's; Capriotti's; etc.  Heck; even Subway.,iKXnctUJOVxenM42ERcekg,Meh at best.

The price of a footlong sub is about $8 but for paying a little bit more than the other competitive sub places the quality of the subs with the meat bread and condiments are very high quality . The theme of the restaurant of course has fire house fire man and 911 items. This location has a large quantity of seating and the employees are very friendly and helpful . Plenty of parking just off Tatum Boulevard north of Greenway . I would recommend this place to friends and family. I will definitely come back and try the other subs that they offer,iKXnctUJOVxenM42ERcekg,I've been curious to try this place for a while and I must say it was a very good toasted sub.  It's a little on the pricer end for a lunch spot but I will keep it in the rotation.,1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,"It's In-N-Out if you've ever been to one you know what to expect. If you haven't the menu isn't huge just get a double double and you will be fine. There is a \not so secret menu\"" if you want things a little different; see google. They have quality food at a very reasonable price. The fries are fresh cut potatoes cooked in vegetable oil which I personally don't like but many people do. It's 5 stars for fast food standards.""",1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,"Wow; this In-N-Out was packed to the gills on Friday night! Despite it being so busy; there wasn't any wait to place our order; and there were still seats left for us to enjoy our meal. Even though they were slammed with orders; we still got service with a smile. Our order didn't take too long to get made; and soon we were enjoying our cheap yet tasty burgers.  I decided to go out on a limb and try something completely foreign to me in the realm of burgers- protein style (Substitute wrapped lettuce for bun)! I had it with cheese; and also animal-style. I shared some fries; well-done (i.e.; they are fried twice instead of once); and a fountain drink.  The burger with no bun and lettuce wrapping was quite good. the crisp; fresh lettuce was a good complement to the hot grilled burger patty and condiments. Despite it being wrapped in the requisite paper pouch; it was still a messy meal as the lettuce does not soak up any of the grease and sauce like a regular bun will; so as I ate more; the paper got soggy and juices started to run down my hand and arm. While I really enjoyed the burger protein-style; I think a single patty just isn't enough for me; since I was still a bit hungry after chowing down so next time I will try it double-double!  The fries; when \well-done\""; are a whole lot better than their regular style. Frying them twice made them quite crispy; and the extra frying adds more flavor to the potatoes. I do appreciate that they use freshly cut potatoes though!  They are open late at this location- Until 1:30 A.M. on the weekends and up to 1 A.M. other nights.   Overall; a good way to start the end of your work week right!""",1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,The best fast food I have ever had; I do not eat fast food; except for this and Five Guys. I have eaten at In N Out my whole life and they always provide a good quality quick meal. I would definitely suggest getting a black-white shake (on the hidden menu); just ask for it and they will give it to you. The black & white shake consists of a half chocolate milkshake and half vanilla milkshake mixed together. It is truly delicious; I enjoyed that as well as the fries which are cut in house before every day; fresh (which is very rare to have fresh things in this day and age). The burger was very good; and has a very good secret sauce (some similiar formula to thousand island) onthe burger which really makes all the other flavors pop out and taste delicious. The food there is near perfect for fast food; and also the staff is incredibly nice and helpful as well ad hard-working. I would suggest this place to anyone who is lacking time but still searching for a good cheap meal.,1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,IN-N-OUT is the -KING- of fast food burger places! I am from SoCal is so is IN-N-OUT.  They are a HUGE hit there; but it's not as much; here in Phoenix I've noticed. Double-Double is a like a backyard burger..delicious! Crispy lettuce; lots of fully-melted cheese (not kinda melted like at most fast food places). Fresh fries from potatoes that they chop up right there in their store; thick shakes made with real ice cream! ....The prices are very reasonable because they stick to the basics: Burgers; Fries; Drinks & Shakes...That's it... No salads or chicken or fish sandwiches here! ....The Best over ALL others!,1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,I support  the idea that in-n-out is a great fast food restaurant for several reasons. First; in my opinion; in-n-out has a great quality of food. For example; the meat is prepared fresh everyday; so it will taste delicious. Also; French fries are prepared well everyday and it's the most fresh French fries I have ever eat. Second; I think the quality of service at in-n-out is high. For instance; the workers there are friendly. Finally; in my point of view; the price of range is low for a student. For example; all social classes can eat from it. In conclusion; I advice everybody to try it and I hope you like it.,1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,In & Out.  If you're missing your gallbladder like I am; In & Out is appropriately named.  LOL  BUT; as a treat every now and then; I don't care.  Though; I'm sure J would love it if we went more often than not.  One of my favorite things about - Cheese paper (cheese thats stuck to the wrapper that you peel off)!!  LOL  :D    Our burgers -   Mine - Single with cheese; extra toast (on bun); add onion.  J's - Single with cheese; extra toast; add onion.          Double - Double; extra toast; add onion.   Reasonably priced food.  J says that the shakes are pretty good.  The fries - Meh.   Skip the fries!!,1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,"I grew up in SoCal and had access to In-N-Out pretty much whenever that craving hit. Then I lived in Colorado and New Mexico for 10 years. Ten long years of torture; unsatisfied cravings and crappy burgers. So it is without shame that I admit that a huge deciding factor in my move to Arizona was the presence of In-N-Out burger.  There's no dollar menu; only 3 combo meals and except for the price; the menu is essentially the same as it was 50 years ago. Yet In-N-Out is ingenious in its simplicity. You always know what to expect: fresh meat; never frozen; fresh cut french fries; fresh lettuce and tomatoes; and real American cheese.   I live just up the street from the Rural and 202 location. Like every other In-N-Out I have visited in the area; the store is clean and the staff are all friendly and each possesses many more brain cells than your average McDonald's or Burger King employee.   If you've never been; or rarely get to go; then you definitely want to go with the Double Double; fries and a shake. If you get to go there more frequently then you might want to scale back to a regular cheeseburger unless you have a really fast metabolism. Also; Google \In-N-Out secret menu\"" for a complete list of all the secret menu items such as animal style burgers and fries; 4X4's and the like. I definitely recommend the animal style fries...so tastey.""",1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,Great for the price!

Lets just say thank goodness there's a GPS and map app on our cell phones nowadays or I might have starved to death in the desert.  This location seems to be easier to get to from everywhere.  (For outsiders; don't let \Tempe\"" fools you; it's closer to Scottsdale and Phoenix than the other ones)  I was told of the not so secret secret menu. So I went and got a cheeseburger animal style. We ordered one order of fries to share and a milkshake. The fries is big enough to share; and is the less impressive item.  Don't know if it is as lightly fried everywhere else; but I like my fries crunchier.  The most impressive thing is the price.  My cheeseburger was $2.20.  It's not a huge burger but it filled me up just fine.  The entire meal was just over $10 with tax for 2.   The menu is simple. And the amount of employees with their cute little white uniforms and the hats are abundant. So even though it was packed the service was fast.   Guess I am now on the In-N-Out bandwagon.

The price and quality are tops!!!,1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,"INTERNAL MEMO   To our valued employees; You are the most integral part of what makes our company wonderful. We want to continue to show our appreciation for all that you do; and that includes the overwhelming number of suggestions we received for our upcoming 60th anniversary.   The management team must admit the diversity and scope of the ideas surprised us; but we feel that it is reflection of our talented work force.   For example; the suggestion that we close our indoor seating to mimic how our original store in 1948 would serve customers is not feasible. In-N-Out now operates in locales which have inclement weather compared to Southern California; and we believe our customers value this change. Moreover; many of our stores are so busy as to displace a significant amount of our customer base.   Along those lines; we are also are unable to implement the suggestion that we separate our customers into two separate lines; one marked \colored\"" and one marked \""white\"" despite how common this was in 1948. In-N-Out's popularity already ensures that lines are often long; and tests the patience of many consumers. We also are uncertain that our African-American; Asian-American; and Latin American customers would find such a decision compatible with In-N-Out's desire to remain inclusive to the largest market share possible.   We also are opposed to adjusting our current portion size to what it was in 1948. It is our opinion that customers would probably notice that we have made our buns bigger; patties thinner; and cheese oilier over the years. Moreover; it is the position of management that importing soft drinks sweetened without corn syrup may be a violation of US law and therefore an unacceptable risk for the company.   Lastly; we believe that lowering our prices to those charged by In-N-Out in 1948 is also not feasible. We believe that such tactics are the sign of desperation and not the hallmark of a healthy and aggressive brand and company. Moreover; this might be viewed as a In-N-Out conceding it is no longer the bargain it once was. The management team strongly disputes this; recently price increases notwithstanding. We also have reason to believe that such a move would be viewed unfavorable as we explore our potential IPO next year.   In closing; we continue to believe that our employees are our greatest asset. We thank you for your input on this momentous occasion in our company's history and encourage your feedback in the future. Sincerely; Your Management Team""",1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,"Of fast food burger joints few places are as well known in areas where they have absolutely no store presence as the chain \In-N-Out Burger\"". While visiting Arizona on a business trip I was aware In-N-Out Burger was a fixture in the area; and it had been well over a decade since the last time I had stopped at one.   Since my first pair of visits to In-N-Out Burgers in California in the early 2000s; I've seen people wearing In-N-Out Burger shirts; read countless articles about the chain; and decided the next time I'm near one I'll give it another shot. My feeling in previous visits to In-N-Out was that while good; and inexpensive there was nothing exceptional about the food there. Would I notice something I didn't before?  When I arrived at my hotel in Tempe Arizona I was immediately able to spot an In-N-Out location and visited several times during my two week stay. On my initial visit I ordered a 3x3 which is three beef patties and three slices of cheese served \""Animal style\"" which is with lettuce; tomato; the beef patties being mustard cooked; pickle; extra Thousand Island style sauce known as \""spread\"" with grilled onions. I also got Lemonade and animal style fries which added spread and onions to the top of my fries. Overall; I thought the burger was very good; especially for the price; but that even with the spread the fries were a bit lacking.   My next visit I went in a slightly different direction; passed on getting any fries and just got a regular 3x3 burger without the animal style additions and a chocolate shake. I noticed that besides the lettuce; tomato and onions it didn't taste as different as I thought it would. I also obtained this through the drive-thru and was given a box rather than a bag; making it somewhat difficult to transport without spilling. The shake I had was excellent; and while I was in the area I tried vanilla;chocolate and strawberry shakes and all were good.  My overall opinion of In-N-Out is this; if you've never visited one it isn't the legendary once in a lifetime experience you may have heard about. However; it is very good for fast food and is quite inexpensive. The most unique characteristic of getting an animal style In-N-Out burger is that it is unique tasting. Nothing exactly tastes quite like an In-N-Out burger; the sharp onions and more sour than big mac sauce thousand island spread give the burger its character.

It is what a burger place should be; a bunch of young teenagers who take pride in their first jobs.  $2 for a great cheeseburger; $6 for a combo w great fries and a milk shake is worthy of a last meal.  The burgers put the high priced burgers in Manhattan NYC to shame---Ray's Hell Burger wannabes.  In and Out is a throwback to a time when fast food was about quality and affordability.

Part of me wants to give this location the 5th star and the other part of me want to be judicious with my perfect scores; so they get 4.5; only because I think \the stand\"" is a little better and deserves the 5 a little more.""",1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,I'm tempted to take off a star for the pricing at In-N-Out Burger as I find their prices to be slightly above what I consider fair for an amazing burger. But since their burgers are great--I will keep them at 5 stars. This location; like many of their locations; is usually very busy. However; considering that they are right down the street from ASU (where everyone loves them) I think their level of busyness is understandable. I've never had to wait more than 7-10 minutes at this location and I usually have a special order and visit during peak times. Besides the fact that their burgers taste amazing (ask practically anyone; they'll say the same thing) I love how fresh everything there is--if it goes into your food it is fresh and never frozen. I also like the fact that In-N-Out Burger pays their workers well; it is refreshing to see a company treat their workers with dignity and respect.,1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,A born and raised Californian; I will always love In-n-Out. Their burgers are 1000 times better than Sonic; and it's so cheap and delightful! I used to hate the fries when I was little; but they've grown on me.,1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,"Typically; I would shy away from writing a review on a fast food chain with 290 locations. However; the In-N-Out experience is anything but the normal fast food dining experience. I am always impressed by the consistency of the In-N-Out Burger experience.   The quality of their never frozen beef patties and fresh; made-to-order burgers is excellent and their customer service is always prompt; efficient; and wonderful. The staff is always courteous and happy--it's good to know that I am supporting a place that seems to treat their employees well.   The inexpensive burgers and fries always hit the spot--I only wish there were locations outside of California and the Southwest to satisfy my fast food burger cravings. But; I suppose staying within a manageable driving distance of the distribution centers is what keeps the food high-quality; fresh; and preservative-free.  My go-to is the protein style double double burger (no bun; just a hearty lettuce wrap around patties that are oozing with cheesy goodness).  When I want to try a variation on my favorite; I just consult the \Not-So-Secret\"" menu on the In-N-Out website!   If you have not been to an In-N-Out burger; I strongly recommend visiting this wonderful fast food place! Expect a long line and short wait; but if you are a fast food/burger lover; you will not be disappointed!  Fun tidbit: Look for the bible verse references on the paper products. Just noticed this after my umpteenth visit to In-N-Out Burger!""",1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,Its good stuff but i dont understand the hype? its all very fresh; taste good but not the best. better than any other fast food burger place. and its cheap! milkshake is good! i do love the fires tho! i love onions but not theres; its just to dam much! just good fast cheap food!,1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,If you want decent fast food at a decent price; In N' Out is definately the place to be!!! The menu is very basic: burgers; fries; drinks; shakes... and I think this is smart because it keeps the long lines (the one downfall of In N' Out) moving. All in all the quality and taste of the food is great!!! No complaints here!!!,1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,I have been to this chain 25 times? 1/2 or more to this location. Every location is busy. People always pleasant and accomodating. Price reasonable. I like the fries but have not gotten them when hot a single time. If hot; even most of the time; 5 stars would be in order.,1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,The only thing that I would have liked better would have been if it would have been closer to campus.  Then again I'd probably have to get my Animal-style cheeseburger and Dr. Pepper EVERYDAY in that case and it would have been mobbed by even more students than it already was. On second thought I'm glad you were just far enough a way that I wasn't always broke as a joke; spending all my money on chocolate shakes.  I was even able to work on my math homework while I was there: DELICIOUS+cheap+quick = In-N-Out!,1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,"In the word's of Spongebob Square Pants; \I'M READY!\"" After ten months of more Mcdonald's than I've probably eaten in the past ten years; I'm ready to leave Australia and return to my home country; the meca of fast food.   Though; I am an avid fan of the New American cuisine (vegan friendly & fair trade) I WANT SOME MEAT. I've made a list of all the fast food spots I plan on hitting up upon arrival back to the states.   This list reads as follows:   1. In N Out 2. Whataburger 3. Wendy's 4. Taco Bell   As you can see; In N Out's my number one and this is simply because it's the best. It's funny to see that Mickey D's isn't even on the list when I shamefully admit that my roommates and I eat there maybe once or twice a week.. gross; I know.   Last night over a double hamburger; fries; and a sundae all for 9 dollars; I began explaining In N Out to my house mate. In N Out isn't a place you go for just anything; most people know exactly what they like and order just that; time and time again.   Though the menu is small and simple the big tastes explain it all. The patty's aren't large in any way but the fresh lettuce; tomato; and onion combined make their burgers hard to get a proper bite in your mouth all at once.   I'm not the biggest fan of the fries so I usually opt away from them and snag a couple of my friends though I have come to In N Out alone before (which is not pathetic on any level). So yeah; like I said I get the same thing every time switching back and forth between their delicious lemonade and milkshakes. The good thing about this location is the Yogurtland in the lot right next door. So if you ever see me around the Grigio; dont be surprised if I head over for some dessert after my 'gourmet meal'.  Note for vegetarians: If you're a vego you can order off the secret special menu. This menu is not spoken about; kinda like that guy on Harry Potter who's name shouldn't be said out loud. If you know about the menu and order it theres no problem but there's no chance you're getting an employee to tell you about it! Sorry; I won't be sharing their secrets here but if you're interested definitely look up their secrets online!  Since I've been living in Australia; I've realized how condiments aren't that big over here and find it frustrating how they charge you 50 cents for dipping sauce. Sometimes I can't be bothered spending extra on sauce since even Macca's is an expensive meal but baby do I love me some sauce. In N Out's; Special Sauce is so delicious and definitely worth the extra money for a packet. Though its probably just a mixture of mayo and ketchup (kinda like big mac sauce) it's an essential add on.   This is fast food but you shouldn't expect it to be quick and easy. Every time I go to In N Out; there's a drive thru line through the parking lot. Thankfully; they've got employees who wear goofy outfits standing outside with Ipads sending your order in when the drive thru is like this.  I understand I may have gotten peoples hopes up but I suggest going into your first In N Out experience with low expectations. I was honestly so dissapointed after my first try at an In N Out near LAX maybe Arizona's In N Out's are just better? I think I had just gotten my own hopes up but whatever the reason was for it to be so bad; I swear after my second try I became addicted.""",1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,How can you not LOVE a burger place where everything is FRESH! No freezers and a burger only costs $2!!!!  This location is great. They have a drive-thru that goes very fast. Often they have a person waiting to take your order instead of yelling it into a speaker box.   For a combo meal you can get a cheeseburger; fries & diet coke for $5 and some change.   The restrooms are clean and the service is very fast. There's plenty of parking & after you eat lunch; walk over to Yogurtland or Starbucks for dessert.,1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,In-expensive and always good. Animal style! Well done fries!,1OA1jo0GlK9sf68f00w8ZQ,I don't understand what all the hype is about with these burgers.  Yes; they are cheap.  Yes; they cook as you order.  No; they are not flavorful and could use some hamburger seasoning.  The huge onion; even for this ShrekCousin; is just too much in a tiny burger.  AND they're always so packed....WHY?  It's like this side of America has given this joint a big name for no reason that I can understand.  The fresh cut fries are too soft.  Fries are meant to be crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with some salt lining the outside; served warm.  The shake was not sweet enough.  I've been here a few times as a suggestion from someone else; so I've given it multiple tries to impress me and it's failed the test each time.  Everytime after eating from this place I'm just not satisfied and would rather eat a hot dog and chips from Circle K with a thirst buster.,WjOz_BVfAkunjIA2yTthyg,This is my local Chipotle; but they've always proven to be pretty consistent whenever I've ventured elsewhere. The ingredients are fresh; the service is usually good; and the prices are pretty fair for what you get. I usually go with three soft tacos so I can switch it up and get one chicken; one steak; and one barbacoa. Variety is good. I also can't resist their chips and medium salsa; something about that hint of lime and the salt they use just makes it too hard for me to say no. Admittedly; sometimes their food really does a number on my stomach; but it tastes so good that I usually just deal with the consequences later. It doesn't hurt that their is this absolutely gorgeous girl that works there too; which ensures that I make a trip at least once a week.,WjOz_BVfAkunjIA2yTthyg,I always have an excellent experience at this Chipotle. They are consistently generous with their portions. The only downside is the ridiculously long lines. I realize Chipotle is extremely popular but at times the lines are insane. But its always worth the wait.  It is too bad that they had to increase the prices recently but hey; who hasn't with this economy. One area of improvement would be to keep the ice tea full. Lately I've had to ask them to refill it because its always bone dry. But they always have a back-up ready immediately.,jN2NAKO5Rn5IT8udZ0imdg,Here's something I never expected to say since becoming a vegetarian: I can't get enough of Fatburger. My boyfriend; who is also a veghead; and I actively avoided this place until we found out last week that it serves a veggie burger. So; we put aside our judgment  and decided to try out the joint. And I'm so; so glad we did.   The veggie burger is made with a premium Boca patty that is thick; juicy and flavorful. Fatburger also features a variety of toppings and customizing items is pretty easy. This is important because I don't like when restaurants have rigid topping standards for their sandwiches (I'm looking at you; Burger King).  I suppose my only complaints are the long wait time and high prices for what I consider a fast food joint. But the food is notches above your typical drive-thru eatery; and the wait is worth it.,jN2NAKO5Rn5IT8udZ0imdg,"I just read Genevieve R's review below and have to say I didn't even know Fatburger had a vegetarian burger.  Who the hell goes to a place named \Fatburger\"" and eats veggies?  ;)  Me; I do the double meat (real meat; you know; beef); double cheese Fatburger. It's double the goodness. You can practically feel your arteries hardening with every drippy gooey delicious bite.  I don't know what it is about this place. But sometimes I just get this weird; \""I need a Fatburger NOW\"" craving. And it doesn't stop until I gorge myself. Then I'm good for a couple of months.  It is a bit on the pricey side; but so far every visit has resulted in a tasty; juicy burger. Fries have ranged between so -so to really good. I have no idea why; but sometimes they just seem.... limp.  Killer shakes too!""",jN2NAKO5Rn5IT8udZ0imdg,Crazy expensive.....medium bacon cheese burger meal-  12.00 2 people running the whole store..... 15-20 minute wait. Food.....meh?  Freddies steakburgers.....best value around !,jN2NAKO5Rn5IT8udZ0imdg,I have never been to Fatburger before and it's right outside the movie theatre I frequent; so we went early to stop for lunch.  Groupons are great!  Now I like hamburgers and fries; but my daughter LOVES them.  And Fatburger didn't disappoint either of us.  The burgers were juicy and cooked just right.  We also ordered bacon on them; and the bacon was cooked nice and crisp with thick slices; none of that see through crap you get at lots of burger joints.  Curly fries were nice and hot and fresh.  And when you have all you can drink diet coke; that's like a big fat cherry on top of a hot fudge sundae!  This place was great; a little expensive for a hamburger place; but really good nonetheless.  We will definitely stop back; especially since we walk right past it at least twice a month when we go to the movies.  Yum.,jN2NAKO5Rn5IT8udZ0imdg,As the rating says. I've experienced better. I will be reviewing the Veggie burger costing about $6. Good chunk of food. Big enough to fill out our stomach even if you skipped morning breakfast. But it was not as tasty. The soy patty was plain tasteless and the whole wheat bread doesn't fit a big burger. It could use more lettuce and less salt.,jN2NAKO5Rn5IT8udZ0imdg,It seems like not so long ago; The Fatburger brand was blowing up; and expansion seemed endless... 10 years later; and Fatburger almost seems like a relic of the past; and isn't the first place people think of when it's.. BURGERTIME. Thanks to a few fantastic Groupons; I've returned to Fatburger; a few times recently. Really impressed! I admit to being a glutton; and enjoying *EVERYTHING* in excess; so The XXL Burger; Chili Cheese Fries; and Lemonade totez hit the spot.. GIANT TASTY MEAL... Even without a Groupon; the price isn't too horrible; and with one; it's an absolute steal! The staff is fab; and friendly; and while the interior decor is modern retro; it's.. now.. really outdated modern retro; and needs to be remodern retrofied. :)  Give Fatburger another whirl! I'm glad I did.,jN2NAKO5Rn5IT8udZ0imdg,"Fat fries are good; but that's probably it. I had a turkey burger that didn't taste much better than something I could make in my microwave. I had \everything\"" but still could barely taste anything. 3 stars is because my brother had an L and it was really L. His also looked much better than mine did. All in all; it is better than most fast food; but really isn't worth it for the price you pay. Your wallet would thank you for hopping across the street to In 'n' Out; and your tastebuds would thank you for driving several miles east to 5 guys.""",tbRu-3NR5za1SEZkszcp5Q,"Do your beans have lard in them?  \Uh; I don't know.\""  (5-10 seconds go by with us awkwardly staring at each other) and I realize I'm going to have to inquire further.  Response included rolling the eyes; a shoulder shrug; and angrily muttering something in Spanish to the folks in the back.  Consensus is they don't really think so.  But; do we really have to endure people like this?  In customer service retail; you don't just stare back at someone and tell them you don't know.  /sigh  Location is easy to find in the Safeway parking lot.  The drive through is right by the two gigantic trash bins in the eastern part of the parking lot (the trash bins indicate they are for tenant's use only).  Food was similar to gringo-like Mexican chains such as Chevy's and On The Border; but prices were much better.  Rice and beans were plain; and beans portion was quite small with the combo (no more than 4-5 teaspoons).  Cheese Quesadilla was dry.  If you're dining in; get something to eat with your hands because the plastic silverware is among the most flexy and fragile I've seen.  They just don't hold up to a Chile Relleno.  Hot sauce served in ketchup squirt bottles.  It's also more of a \""medium sauce\"" though.""",tbRu-3NR5za1SEZkszcp5Q,Depends what you are in the mood for; but for $3-5 for a good sized carne asada or breakfast burrito; it's hard to beat. This is by no means 'traditional' Mexican food though. It is good. It is 24hr. It's not going to win any authentic or best of XYZ awards; but if your looking for a burrito fix; hangover remedy; or just something cheap - this is your place.,tbRu-3NR5za1SEZkszcp5Q,Honestly; I would normally never go to a place like this. Fast food and Mexican food together just doesn't seem like a good combo. I love Mexican food so I'm definitely picky when it comes to it. This place was just alright; the costs were surprisingly pricy for fast food; I've seen close to the same prices at an actual Mexican restaurant. The service was just okay; the lady wasn't super friendly but she wasn't rude either. The chicken wasn't my favorite; and the red and green sauce were just pure liquid; nothing special. It wasn't terrible but I probably won't come here again.,tbRu-3NR5za1SEZkszcp5Q,Honestly; I would normally never go to a place like this.

I'd avoid this place ... there are other options for Mexican food that aren't too far away.,tbRu-3NR5za1SEZkszcp5Q,Great prices; nice salsa/condiment bar inside; great daily specials like 99 cent taco Monday and Tuesday; as well as $1.99 burritos those same days.

It's not a high-end Mexican place by a stretch; but they do a solid job at making really tasty meals for a really cheap price.

They are a fast food Mexican joint; but I enjoyed my meal.    Likes~ it is very cheapo-la to eat here.  I like how they have their restaurant set up with several flat screen TV's broadcasting sports and news (you don't get that at Caramba's nor Carolina's)...  I had their Carne Asada Torta meal.  It was very good and extremely cheap.  I've also had their Carnitas Torta and Burrito and their Pollo Asado Quesadilla; all were very good.  Did I mention they are cheap to eat!

Student specials too,tbRu-3NR5za1SEZkszcp5Q,I don't think I've ever been here during daylight. Or even before 10pm. I'm thankful they are open 24 hours; as very few places close to home are (I think McDonald's is - on weekends). Greasy; completely bad for you; huge portion; cheap; but always tasty Mexican food. Decent end to curb any late night cravings on the way home from a night out!,Nh9BjVPHdrZMn2naUxO6hg,We love coming here for dinner or getting take out. It is always consistently good food. The chips and guacamole are great and you get good portions for the price. Only drawback is they use light and dark meat chicken; would love for it to be just white meat.,Nh9BjVPHdrZMn2naUxO6hg,One of my favorite places.  Burritos are awesome; chips and guac is great.  This chipotle's taste I believe is better than other chipotle's; but that could be my imagination.  Overall; great quality food that's well priced and taste great.,Nh9BjVPHdrZMn2naUxO6hg,I really wanted to love this place; especially as they offered such a nice deal (BOGO) for teachers recently. But I didn't; and it had nothing to do with the service as other reviewers have mentioned. We did have to wait in line for about 45 minutes; but I know it was because of the teacher promotion; and I was happy to wait my turn. The portions are; indeed; massive - but the food was only so-so.   I was stoked that they had organic; hormone free chicken -- but was bummed that they were 'out' of it (and according to a friend; had been out of it for at least a month... due to a supply shortage?). Regardless; I ordered a double wrapped pork burrito and a chicken bowl. The chicken was really disgusting - super chewy; poorly cooked thighs; and the pork was slightly better but just tasted a little 'off'. The rice was slightly greasy;  and while the other toppings were ok; I went there for the meat; and having that be bad in both of my meals (I ordered one for the next day but tried them both that evening while they were fresh) just was a bit of a buzzkill. The place is also fairly pricey for a casual take out joint.   I doubt I'll go there again; but if I do for some reason; I'll try the vegetarian option and update this review accordingly.,Nh9BjVPHdrZMn2naUxO6hg,Chipotle has always been good to me when I am in a hurry and this is no exception. People who complain about the price should go get food poisoning at some hole in the wall place or at least research it's price range beforehand online (like using yelp DUH) They are fast enough for how busy it gets and I have never had a problem they don't instantly fix. I suggest ordering online because if they get it wrong it's free; and usually still edible / good. The one off the 101 by costco has given me personally at least 15 free burritos/ bowls.

Yeah they have good chips and guac but honestly it will be hard to go there any more with the other selections here in the valley.  They are always clean and friendly when I have been in and no issues with the food; but just the cost & selections vs. the others has me forgetting about Chipotle.,dmXfK7G0h8zknsR2dfr1bw,"This place came highly recommended by my foodie mates! And today; we finally had the chance to give their offerings a go!

We had to repeat ourselves 4 times to order our food; 2 times to correct out order. We also told the food clerk that it's our first time here.  After we placed our order; we moved forward to pay at the window. The cashier looked as if we were bothering her with something. No greeting; no smile; and was not helpful at all when we asked her (what the order taker did not answer) what comes with the 3 chicken fingers. Our inquiry was; AGAIN; ignored and left unanswered.  After paying; we picked up our orders. We asked; AGAIN; what comes with the 3 chicken fingers.

I mean; I wasn't scared. The floors were spotless; the tables gleamed; even the serving counter was immaculate. The place where food was put behind the counter was something my anal retentive self fell in love with - it was all sparkly clean; napkins piled neatly and in an orderly fashion. I nearly fainted.

I wasn't paying attention when I pulled into the parking lot and I thought I was going to Whataburger. Imagine my surprise when all I saw was hotdogs on the menu! Took me a minute to figure out why; but once I did; since I was there; I thought I'd try something. Having never been to a Wienerschnitzel before I had to rely on the photos to show me what to expect. Saw the sauerkraut dog and had to order that; has mustard too; perfect way to eat a hot dog. Shakes were on sale; so i got a chocolate one. The shake was ok; it didn't make it back to the office; but not because it was 'awesome'; it was because I was thirsty and that's all I had. Got to the office; opened the bag; pulled out the hotdog and; well; was quite disappointed. The photo shows a HOTDOG in a bun with a nice stripe of mustard and a heaping amount of sauerkraut. That is not what I got. I got a hotdog in a BUN; with about a teaspoon of sauerkraut that looked like it was dipped in mustard. Ok; so i'm used to the Costco hotdogs; where you can actually see the dog sticking out each side; so i was expecting as such. That's how the photo looked; but no; no dog sticking out. took me two bites each end to find the hot dog. and it was no bigger around than my finger and was tasteless. Won't go there again.,zxjMiqlfUuIQRltSuj9FpQ,Ok I know this is by the college and just fast food but now with Angus Beef Hot dogs you gotta try this place.

I went in with a coupon for lunch as I was working down by ASU that day. I placed my order to find out that it would have just been cheaper if I had ordered the combo instead; but then discovered that on top of it all the clerk rang me up wrong. This isn't usually a big deal; so I just asked that they correct my order to the pretzel bun chili dogs that I enjoy so very very much.  Short version of the story was that the manager was rude and I had to swipe my card again for another 60-something cents for the pretzel bun upgrades. A good manager would have just done it for having screwed up my order but he copped an attitude with me as well.   Maybe he mistook me for an ASU student trying to cause him trouble and not; you know; a paying customer. Who knows.  Just make sure you speak slowly and make them read your order back to you (TWICE) and you should be fine.,zxjMiqlfUuIQRltSuj9FpQ,"Back in the day Der Wienerschnitzel was consistently cheap at its very many locations but there aren't too many around anymore and you gotta be careful with your order and use coupons to eat at the prices its quality would mandate.

The Manger/operator guy.  Sure; the food here isn't all that bad.  Probably a half a notch or so higher than most of the hot slop fast food you can get for lunch.  Most of the crew members are pretty attentive; don't seem to be meth addicted; and I see them cleaning the tables on a regular basis.  Looks like the crew changes over quite often; and I know why.  My beef is not with the crew members; oh no.  Not with the food or cleanliness of the store.  Nope.  The Manager guy; the guy who looks like a real pussy version of John Leguizamo.  This guy ruins about every trip I have to this joint.  That is my problem with this joint.  Elaboration will proceed now.  This guy is without a doubt one of the biggest assholes I have ever encountered in the fast food industry.  Actually; one of the biggest assholes period.  What a douche bag.  Seems like any time I have a coupon; this guy will literally butt in the middle of the order; give me a ration of shit and do about anything possible not to use it.  Seriously; what is it; 30 cents?  I had a store coupon that was on a tray liner a while ago and this nutsack got in the middle of the order; cancelled it and refused to let the coupon be used.  I asked why and he said it was not legit (why was it on the tray liner then fuckhead?) I checked the menu; they would have lost 10 cents.  Lady taking my order after P.J.L. (pussy John Leguizamo) walked away pretty embarassed said \sorry\""  Not her fault.  Never saw her working there after then; was probably tired of that guys shit.  I don't blame you.  Last trip here; they have promos on their drink cups for free shit.  Awesome.  We all know this is the garbage that costs them nothing but I am a sucker for something free.  On my trip before the last; I got one for a free corndog.  SCORE!  I cash it in on my last trip; and the guy ringing up the order said it would be on a different ticket.  No sweat; I could give a shit less as long as I get my corndog.  Go to get my order; ask where the corndog is.  P.J.L. butts in the middle of the order; says \""This is your order; this is what you have\"" and was a fucking prick about it.  Me; the customer.  Yanks the receipt out of my hand; gives me an attitude about it.  Who the fuck talks to a customer like that; even at a low rent fast food joint?  Fuck you.  Seriously.  The guy who took my order tried to explain the situation and dicknose literally looks at him; puts his hand in front of the guys face; and says \""ssssshhhhhh\"" and snaps his fingers the same way I do to my dogs to keep them barking or eating drywall.  Who degrades their employees like that?  All he was trying to do was explain my free item was on another ticket.  Instead of listening; he made a complete asshat out of himself.  It was a corndog; what does that cost you anyway; about 12 cents in batter; a stick; and a combination of horse eyeballs and badger penis meat?

While treating my severely pregnant friend to a chili cheese dog today at Wienerschnitzel.. We experience what we like to refer to as the most odd; awkward and severely uncomfortable situation ever experienced at such a \fine establishment.\"" We place our order; Young nice girl... Slightly clueless though. I order what I feel is pretty damn simple; chili cheese Coney;all beef of course; and a small curly fry. My friend orders large curly fry and a chilli cheese dog.   We sit down and wait for  our food... 5 to 10 minutes later my tray arrives -all beef chili cheese dog and a small regular fry. The same nice; young ; sweet and again sightly clueless girl smiles.. I remind her I ordered the curly fry and she quickly remembers that yes; I did order a curly fry and takes the tray back. In the meantime my friends food arrives; and it looks fucking delicious. Five minutes goes by and this young buck; with a pretty freaking sweet headset; comes over to our table.. He proceeds to tell me that \""small curly fries have an up charge of $.30 cents.\"" We look at each other;  we look at him and say okay? Let's just give you an idea of how awkward the next 15 seconds went....Silence. He tells us again \""small curly fries are $.30 cents more than a regular fry... You ordered a  curly fry and she only charged you for a regular fry; so it's $.30 cents more.\"" At this point we are baffled... My friend finally asked \""oh she's supposed to give you $.30 cents more for you guys messing up her order?\"" He of course replies yes like that's normal.. Because again for probably the fifth time now he's reminded us that it's a $.30 cents up charge for a curly fry. Well; I let him know that I paid with a credit card and that I do not have any cash; he said that's okay we take credit card... No sir I do not want to put $.30 cents on my credit card because you messed up my order --I'll pass thank you very much. He smiles fixes his headset; thrust his hips left to right and is on his way back to his kingdom of wieners. At this point we could only laugh and think of how freaking pathetic it is that for $.30 cents they made themselves look like assholes.  Let's be honest; it's only $.30 cents...But I feel that that statement goes both ways.  Don't you worry folks; the story is not over; five minutes later he brings over the original small fry... That is now of course cold.  Good old Wienerschnitzel... Where you have to pay for their mistakes.""",k-I2IJrEFAikJMqfzXUl8g,The customer service was horrible. The host did not pay any attention to us. The waitress could care less about our table and just brought the food out and left.

I made my own salad with solid albacore tuna with their fresh veggies and the balsamic dressing on the side. Everyone's order was correct and prompt and prices were great.

They are also doing cork recycling; one of the few that do.  A definite 5+++++ stars.,k-I2IJrEFAikJMqfzXUl8g,A group (6) of us went for lunch today to celebrate my birthday. Perfect day for patio seating; which they had ample tables available.  Server was very attentive and friendly.   Looking through the diverse menu I see lots of options that sound great. Great options of soup; salad; entrees; sandwiches and burgers. I settle for a cup of the Crab corn chowder which was very good. Extra points for serving oyster crackers with the soup as many do not. The chowder was the right consistency of thickness.   I opted for the build a burger option. There are diverse options to make your burger from buns; traditional toppings; or special toppings like a portabella cap; roasted chile; etc.  My burger was a ciabatta Kobe burger with pepper jack; roasted chile; guac; spinach and chipotle aioli. Once I got the burger which looked awesome; I cut it in half and noticed the patty was thin. Maybe a 1/4lb and it had a very uniform circular shape as is if it came from a frozen pack.  I told myself that they probably had a press back there and to proceed. The guac looked a darker brown than usual as if it had been out or wasn't freshly made. They had avocados on the menu so I assumed it was fresh. The bun was grilled; spinach super fresh drenched in some cheese and a chiles.   First bite was good and got a bit of everything but something was off. After dissecting a bit the guac definitely tasted as if it came out a package and the Kobe was a frozen hockey puck. Upon examining the grilled results of the Kobe it resembles more I a black bean veggie patty; which I made sure no one else at the table had ordered.    For a place that's supposed to be a burger joint this is an extreme disappointment. I can get a burger at a better price that's handmade and way more fresh. Cutting corners and costs on guac when you have fresh avocados is not very endearing either.

The prices are very reasonable; and the menu is very extensive offering everything from salads to appetizers and everything in between such as burgers and healthy sandwiches. I had the Pinnacle chicken sandwich and it was absolutely scrumptious...I ordered mine in ciabatta bread and it came with lettuce; tomato; cheese; bacon and avocado.  The service was very friendly and efficient and certainly didn't miss a beat. They also have a lovely patio and serve breakfast. Highly recommended. Will return without a doubt.,k-I2IJrEFAikJMqfzXUl8g,I had just finished the Pinnacle Peak hike and was hungry tired and thirsty.  There were some flyers at the trail head for the Pinnacle Grill that offered a discount. I decided to give the place a try. My hamburger was absolutely superb.  The bun was very fresh (Perhaps they make them there) The large angus patty was cooked to the medium rare I ordered; and the side salad was large and had a nice variety of greens and other salad ingredients.The service was superb.  The meal was appropriately priced.  I am not from Arizona; but would definitely return to this place.,k-I2IJrEFAikJMqfzXUl8g,Beautiful location with mountains all around. Not cheap but the food was very good. I had grilled salmon on an onion roll with lettuce and goat cheese and a few other things with a side of sweet potato fries ( I have had better sweet potato fries) washed down with a couple Fat Tires ($5 each; not bad). My wife had a grilled chicken salad with spring mix and pears grape tomatoes and goat cheese with a raspberry vinaigrette; she loved it. If you are in the area it's a good lunch. They have an outdoor; dog-friendly patio.,k-I2IJrEFAikJMqfzXUl8g,For the most part the menu is divided into three sections; appetizers; soups and salads; and burgers and sandwiches. This is not your average burger joint however! The choices are enormous for all of the categories and if that was not enough the burger section is truly build your own from the type of burger (13 types to choose from including non-meat selections); 8 kinds of buns; cheese; toppings; sauces; and more.  Fortunately they do offer prebuilt selections as well and I went for the Pinnacle Salmon burger which turned out to be the most amazing salmon burger I have ever tasted -- period. Before the burger I had a cup of the Kickin' Crab Corn Chowder which was wonderful -- but a cup? What they call a cup would be a bowl in any place I am used to.  In general the portions are very large considering the prices and our table over ordered selecting a couple of appetizers to try as well. The Chips & Guacamole are very good; the Tomato & Mozzarella is outstanding; and the Pinnacle Fries are awesome.  It seems that most places that try to be incredibly flexible with their menus and are generous with their portions compromise somewhere on quality to get there. The Pinnacle Grill; however; seems to be an exception where quality; flexibility; and quantity come together in a truly amazing combination. If you are anywhere in the area do make this a stop - you will certainly be glad you did.,k-I2IJrEFAikJMqfzXUl8g,Its now the place my whole family celebrates their birthday!

Check it out!,k-I2IJrEFAikJMqfzXUl8g,Yesterday was my first visit to Pinnacle Grill and I have to say I was very happy we gave it a try. It was kind of empty due to seasonality; but that actually worked in our favor as we got some time to chat with our awesome server Lisa. She was a lot of fun; great with the kids; and made some wonderful recommendations; along with stellar service. The menu is in somewhat of a transition as they are adding new items and taking off some others. Overall the menu is diverse offering everything from great burgers to higher end tasty dishes. My son built his own burger which was delicious. Quality Angus beef cooked as ordered. My daughter ordered the fried calamari and thought it was great. My wife ordered the ribs and enjoyed them as well. I had the chicken marsala which was a varied version of the traditional; but it was delicious with a richly flavored sauce. Also as a starter we shared some chicken wings and they were nicely cooked and tasty... not too spicy either. One of the great qualities of this place is that the food is original and fresh with everything homemade as far as we could tell. It is so hard to find good quality food as we have become overrun by the Olive Garden style restaurants of today. This place is not a chain! Great food at a reasonable price. I will be happy to go back in the future and look forward to trying new menu items as well as being served by Lisa. Enjoy Pinnacle Grill as we did. A great place tucked away off the beaten path; but well worth the excursion.,UCjtaUCtJPbTUouHtQURvQ,So; I think I have been to most of the Chipotles in the state.  The one thing they all have is consistency.  It is always great to pop in real quick and grab a bite.  At high noon at most locations you can wait a little longer; but it still isn't bad.  Their chicken is good; with next to no chewy bits.  I have been on a Carnitas kick of late.  Always juicy and never dry.  It is a little more expensive then most fast food joints; but the quality is way better.  Love Chipotle!,UCjtaUCtJPbTUouHtQURvQ,Hey Chipotle; where is the meat????  Most inconsistent fast food place; these days I have to search for chicken or steak in my chicken/steak bowl. What's going on? Why is this place being so skimpy on the meat? No and I do not appreciate Chipotle trying to sneak an approve for antibiotic fed meat.  I do not want to pay $6.50 for a bowl of rice and beans. There maybe relation between Chipotle's stock price ($400+) and their quality. Higher the stock price; more wall street expectations of more profits and lower quality.,UCjtaUCtJPbTUouHtQURvQ,Chipotle is one of my favorite places to eat thats fast and cheap.    The menu is pretty straight-forward.  Tacos; burritos; bowls... pick your ingredients; move along.  Your meal will be assembled at light-speed so stay sharp!  If you really only want a LITTLE BIT of sour cream or salsa or whatever; say so LOUDLY and CLEARLY or else it will get slopped on there like everything else.    It can get really crowded during weekday lunch; go at 11:00 or 1:00 to avoid the rush - or if you are going to pick up; fax your order in ahead of time.,UCjtaUCtJPbTUouHtQURvQ,"Best things about Chipotle:  its cheap (under 8 bucks); its fresh; fast; and has ridiculously awesome guac; and they're consistent.   I'm not gunna lie - though not exactly \mexican\"" food; they have great food and one of my favorite burritos anywhere.  This location is one of the best I've been to; as the food is awesomely fresh and hot and the wait is small.  It also has a lot of seating; both inside and out; but the backs are wicked uncomfortable in the benches.  The rest of the \""ambiance\"" is pretty normal and not exciting.   The sizes are huge; from burrito to salads.  The chicken is moist and flavorful; the steak is good and not overcooked; and you have different options for beans (even though I dont eat them).  I love their white lime-cilantro rice; the sour creme is not bitter; they have a great pico; and I have a love of the cheese they have.  My favorite things here are the burritos and taco bowls - with LOTS of guac - with chips and guac on the side; topped with their yummy house lime-salt. Also; they serve Coke products here; a big plus to us diet coke fiends.    If you like big burritos and americanized mexican food; you've gotta do yourself the favor of checkin this place out.""",UCjtaUCtJPbTUouHtQURvQ,PROS: Most of the food items like the lettuce tasted fresh. They have a great variety and give you exactly what you ask for.   the staff inside was fast and friendly; a long line was a short wait!   They served margaritas; beer; and bottled water; just in case you're really thirsty :) and it was pretty cheap; too!  CONS: I have been to many a Chipotle; and I was a bit disappointed; they didn't give that much meat at all. Plus; the chicken was colder than normal. They scooped me too much rice and mild salsa.   Got chips and guacamole; the guacamole had way too much onion in it; or the pieces were way too big.   OVERALL: This chipotle was average! I know you guys can do soo much better.,UCjtaUCtJPbTUouHtQURvQ,Made the mistake of going here right at the stroke of 12PM... lines around the block. At first I thought they were giving away free stuff... but no such luck on my part.  If you have ever eaten at a Chipotle before; this is going to be no great surprise when I tell you... Its the same as every other place!  If you have never eaten here before... The burritos are HUGE! The prices are very reasonable for the amount of food you get. And the food was fresh and hot.  I had a burrito bowl with 1/2 carnitas and 1/2 barbacoa beef. Yum.  This location does have outdoor seating which was nice today.   I also enjoy reading the cutsie messages they put on their cups.,UCjtaUCtJPbTUouHtQURvQ,I am hard to please.  That said; I am always elated when I dine at Chipotle--any Chipotle.  And since I've been to this location a little more often than the others; I choose to review this location.  I am amazed at the quality of the meal--fresh ingredients; plenty of meat; clean interior--modernity at it's best.  The prices are ridiculous--six and change for a huge fresh-Mex burrito with steak or chicken or pork ... I just wanted to chime in on how much I appreciate 'em.,UCjtaUCtJPbTUouHtQURvQ,The best rice and beans food ever.  The meat is there; you can see the 1 oz put on there; and you can almost taste it; but almost doesn't count.  The guacamole is priced at like 2-4 avocados; 400% or so markup; not bad.  Don't come here; because its good as junk food.  Carbs; and more carbs with a little fiber and maybe protein.,UCjtaUCtJPbTUouHtQURvQ,I first off have to say I love Chipotle! Good food; pretty decent price; for the new age fast food market (fast food that isn't a burger). Their chicken is my fave and their guac and chips are the best in town I think.   However; I for the first time today took what seemed to be the advantage of ordering online. My office all wanted lunch from there and the line can be pretty ridiculous at noon; so I figured I would pre order then just walk in pay and be on my happy way. Not so much. I will say that the ordering process is great; very easy and fast; took just a few minutes then hit send. But when I got there is when the annoyances started. Our food was not ready on time. I made a point to watch the person that walked in right after us and see how quickly they got out of the building; they won; we were still trying to pay for our order. It was seemingly very unorganized. The girl at the register kind of pointed us in a direction where someone would come out from the kitchen to give us our order; we were not allowed to pay or fill drinks while we were waiting; and it was to difficult to ask any questions that we were too frustrated to ask for extra salsa.   On top of that while we were waiting the lady that was making our food came out in the middle of prep to talk to another customer about franchise opportunities and how much their building rent was. **Note to the jerk off that thought it would be a god idea to pull the manager out of the kitchen to discuss business at noon on a Monday: HELLO!? Are you serious? Time and place buddy; time and place. Call Corp for these silly questions. Arg!   Anyway; the food is good; but they really need to get a better handle on their service. A bit of a cluster f*** if you know what I mean. I am a huge fan of ordering online and getting things fast; but I do not recommend using these opportunities at Chipotle.,UCjtaUCtJPbTUouHtQURvQ,Chipotle is a great place to get a fast; reasonably priced vegan meal. I always order the vegetarian bowl with rice; black beans (pinto beans are not vegan); grilled peppers and onions; pico de gallo and hot salsa; corn; guacamole; and lettuce. Yum. My husband gets the same in a burrito; and sometimes adds cheese. Good; fast; and filling. One reviewer here could do with fewer onions. I could do with less cilantro and perhaps brown rice instead of white; but other than that; no complaints.,IT65TI-FZ-aTeRybXRoOrg,"I cannot really remember a time when I was a customer somewhere and I was treated so well with genuine friendliness. Not the \yeah you're spending money here so we will treat you nice;\"" but like they want to become your friend or something. Da Burger Shack as I was told; has been at this location for about 8 months now which is probably why I never heard of it. The motto on their sign outside is \""We welcome you like family not as a stranger.\"" Which was hopeful; I'm a sucker for small town treatment.   We were greeted nicely upon coming in; I noticed that they had some sort of contraption that produces cold drip coffee. Looks cool and tastes great. The atmosphere was like a mix between Cheba Hut (w/o the marijuana references); Hippie Gypsy; and a tropical hut. Whoever decorated that place has great taste in music and icons. The setting was small but cozy and very colorful down to the tables being painted.  There was nice outdoor seating but it was too warm outside to brave the elements. I was shocked to see they offer something called the \""Big Tsunami;\"" which is 10 ground beef patties topped with pastramis; 10 slices of American cheese; 2 fried eggs; diced onion; tomatoes; lettuce; and their special sauce (which is fabulous btw) all for $20~if you get the combo for $1.75 more you get chili cheese fries and 2 drinks. It is recommended for 5 or more people. Then I noticed they have something called Big Moke Burger which is 4 patties with 4 slices of cheese; bacon; carmelized onions and so forth for $9. They also have a Hawaiian Loco Moco plate. Alas; I did not try the cheesecake I saw they had in their refrigerated case.   The food:  Fries-they give you a TON of fries for a regular order; I hate to see (or maybe love?) what a 'large' looks like. They seem to be the frozen crinkle kind. They were still good; my only suggestion is to maybe make homemade; proprietary house fries?  Burger-great; although I don't eat meat my partner loved his burger. It seemed to be loaded with bacon and I was assured it was quality bacon; not the cheap kind they give you at fast food places. They use really soft; buttery kaiser rolls for the bun. My only gripe is that I wish they would offer a Boca; Morningstar or  Amy's veggie patty instead of a squishy portabello mushroom. I just don't feel those textures match up with a bun.  Conclusion: so much good food for very little money; do not come here on a diet. Of course you could try to get away with it by eating their salads but come on; willpower is not your strong suit. During our meal the older gentleman checked on us and we chatted; I wanted to get up and give him a hug and I don't like touching people. So sweet to everyone who came in and everyone seemed to be regulars; it was like Cheers; he knew everyone's name. He's giving the owner from Tokyo House a run for his money in hospitality and I love that guy.   I have some Kiwi's from New Zealand that I would love to bring here and I'm sure they will love it.

Good people; good simple food with enough of a twist to differentiate - toasted bun; grilled onions; etc.  Keep up the work!   Nice prices; good value; clean place - the owners are really nice and the patio is awesome when the weather is nice (as it was today).  I will definitely come back again.,IT65TI-FZ-aTeRybXRoOrg,Da Burger Shack has two things you rarely find in the valley.    A genuine friendly staff and HARIO COLD DRIP COFFEE!!!  I'm somewhat torn to tell the world; so I can horde it all for myself.  That hunk of wood and glass next to the counter is actually an expensive way to brew low acid strong coffee.  For whatever reason it's in the shack and they sell it.   I can't write enough how friendly the staff were.  They really bring that island friendliness; in the typical cold city culture.    As for burgers; my first trip was daily dealled with fish n chips.   The second outing was Cal Burger filled.  Both meals were satisfying; but not sensational.  Their daily deal is an outstanding value; so outstanding it seems to be always sold out when I stop by.      As for atmosphere; not the place to bring your first date; but definitely a good place to call home after several outings in need for comfort foods.  The food is a 3 plus 1 for coffee and service.  I'll be back for the rest of their pictured food and coffee of course.,NK-lGc4ZpuuduTAwK5Y24g,This Chipotle went above and beyond. I feel that it is too common today for big companies not to take care of their customers; but to give them a product as cheap as possibly while quality and service suffer. I never find that to be the case with Chipotle and especially at this location. I am moving to a new apt and after being mistreated and robbed from Direct TV and Century Link among many others. I felt as if no large company actually valued their customers anymore. This Chipotle ended my day a little better by proving me wrong. I requested steak for my burrito which they were momentarily out of. I had to wait literally less than a minute for the steak to finish being prepared. Because of my brief wait Chipotle comped my meal. Shit if I ordered something from a traditional fast food restaurant it still would have taken longer than the 2 minutes it took to make my burrito. I understand this isn't something Chipotle will do every time in this situation. But I have always had a great experience at Chipotle so on top of that today they reminded me; not only do we put out a great; fast product; we also give a fuck! Thank you to the crew working tonight at 8:30!,NK-lGc4ZpuuduTAwK5Y24g,*sniff* I can't believe I was made to cry (on the inside) no less on New Year's Eve. My hubby and I came here thinking we would split a burrito since I know how big the burritos can be at Chipotle.    We waited in line. I watched the two guys in front of me each get 2 tortillas each for their burrito and the girl behind the line really piled on the rice; beans; and their choice of meat. I was thinking; wow; these burritos are even bigger than what I remembered.   Then when it came my turn for my burrito; the girl behind the counter took one look at petite me and took out one tortilla and gave me a skimpy serving of rice; beans; and seriously like 5 pieces of meat. I felt so crest fallen.  I looked at the measly portion that was going to be my burrito; I looked at the girl behind the counter and asked why the two guys in front of me got such massive burritos but not me. She just rolled her eyes at me and went on to the next costumer.   Boy; was I disappointed. And I checked too with those two young guys in case they paid extra for their mega massive burritos. Nope; same price as what I paid.   I seriously wanted to take a photo of my burrito next to theirs cause mine would look like the runt of the litter. It was so pathetically so much smaller in size.   I thought maybe it was an off night but from reading the other reviews; many other customers have received the same uneven service.   Chipotle corporate; you should take note since as corporate you take such pride in providing a good product and service- that is the Chipotle brand and signature.   Well; this particular location is not making the grade.

I mean what else can you say that hasn't already been said? This location is always busy no matter when you come; but the food is good (albeit it is getting expensive) and the service has been good. Just remember; get to this location early if you want to eat and be able to sit; otherwise you are out of luck!,CMI3SF1-YwAEfUXYkKS53Q,First time to this Franchise and this location. Well lit; in strip mall; good parking and no line at 7:30 pm. I ordered a Taco meal; menu did not specify how many Taco's included. You are asked soft or crispy tortilla ( make sure your tortilla is steamed nice a hot ); by the time I started to eat mind; it was cold. Next choose your meat; ( make sure meat is stirred ) my meat was cold. Next you get to choose; lettuce; salsa; sour cream; guacamole ( extra cost ). Needless to say my Taco's was cold and soggy ( to much salsa ). But my beer was cold! My friend had a chicken Burrito; it was okay; not warm; soggy; taste was okay. The employees tried to be friendly but I could tell they did not want to be there. Total for this visit-meal 1 Taco meal; 1 Burrito; 1 Beer and 1 small fountain drink was $20.00.,CMI3SF1-YwAEfUXYkKS53Q,My fave Chipotle location! This one gets pretty crowded so be wary.  I always get bowl here whether it is steak or carnitas with everything on it! The workers here do a great job with portions and are so friendly! Price is a bit steep for essentially the contents of a burrito in a bowl; but the quality and freshness makes up for it. They serve alcohol and soda as well.  Good; open seating indoors and a patio out front.,CMI3SF1-YwAEfUXYkKS53Q,Fast service as usual; and they are always nice. The food tastes great and the prices are very good for what you get.,0BXtWaDWN6Lh7T8mbbZniw,Pizza & Krispy Krunchy chicken is a lifesaver. I called last week for my sons birthday party of 150 people. It was all last minute thing. I called a day before; the birthday Party. They had great wings; Pizza was really good Kids loved it; definitely try there chicken salad. They arrived 20 minutes before the given time; which was great. We were all so hungry. I will order food from here next time. Price was very reasonable. The fact that it was also halal made it easy to pick out for our party.,0BXtWaDWN6Lh7T8mbbZniw,Like some others; I wish zero stars was an option. This place is a kitchen nightmare episode at best. First of all they have a sign they are not serving any chicken except wings. No fried chicken of any kind. The guy at the register; who I think is an owner; explained you couldn't get the 40 wings option; but could order in increments of 20?!? Oh wait! That's so it will be more expensive. Since we have always liked the food from the Krispy Krunchy chicken on Buckeye we still gave it a chance. I paid; then the man went straight over and started making the food without washing his hands or using gloves. At one point he left and went to the liquor store next door then came back?? Still with a shred of hope it would be as good as the other location we waited. Final verdict-pizza was bland; wings had watered down sauce and I will never ever ever ever ever go back. Definitely worth the extra miles to go to the one in the WY market on Buckeye.,0BXtWaDWN6Lh7T8mbbZniw,"Worst customer experience I have ever received from a restaurant. I work for a company that deals with Value Card Alliance and this place accepts our Valued Card scripts. However; you cannot place a order on the phone with Value Card. They will force you to go into their location to place an order due to past customers have complained about how long the wait is when ordering on the phone. Phone orders are so customers do not have to sit and wait at a location for their food. I asked to speak with the manager regarding this and the lady said \I'm in charge!\"" I asked her to explain why I can't order on the phone if using Value Card due to it is just like paying with cash. All the \""manager\"" said was \""people who use Value Card take too long to come pick up their orders and it is annoying to hear them complain about it being cold due to them not picking up on time.\"" If you are going to offer for phone orders and give a customer a time frame to pick it up; if the cost shows up after the time frame that is the customers fault. That does not mean you should deny a customer from ordering. Also when I told the \""manager\"" I'd just pay with cash then she was EXTREMELY rude on the phone. Never have I ever ordered from a restaurant and receive such poor customer experience. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE!! If you want great pizza with great customer experience ESPECIALLY for a business that deals with Value Card I recommend you going to Rosati's Pizza on 40th St and Thomas. They take all orders on the phone and extremely friendly especially to businesses.""",0BXtWaDWN6Lh7T8mbbZniw,Skip this place. I try not to be negative but this place was awful. Very bad and scary location. Pizza was gross; almost no cheese and toppings were spongy and just weird. The fried chicken was edible at best; greasy and I feared it wasn't cooked through. The jambalaya was so dry and tasted awful. We waited 45 minutes. Living Social and Groupon need to rethink who they do business with. It was so shady there we took our food to a Costco parking lot and tailgated. I can overlook a lot if the food is good but this was not good food. Waste of time and money.,_6rzEUOYbo7lgtkSKkKS9g,Finally got to this stupid place.  God it is far away.  I got a mushroom swiss burger.  It was okay.  I didn't end up finishing it because it was just sort of overly greasy and was making me sick.  Mushrooms can be cooked without being greasy.  I know they can! The fries were a special kind of terrible.  Crinkle-cut fries are some of my favorites but these just had no flavor.  They needed way more salt. My shake was a cookie dough shake.  It was okay but the cookie dough pieces were too large for the straw and they didn't give me a spoon.  So by the time I was done; I had a cup full of cookie dough.  Definitely get something different if I go again. Ultimately I found the menu to be unorganized; the prices to be a tad high; and the drive-thru to be way too slow.  Just not a very good experience for a place that had a parking lot full of people.  Then again; it's not like they have any options in Surprise.,_6rzEUOYbo7lgtkSKkKS9g,"Ive been to Culvers alot.

I tried the mushroom swiss burger which was very juicy; and the meat had an interesting texture - moist on the inside; slightly crisp on the outside.  The bun was very buttery.  I tried a little of the chili cheese fries; which were pretty tasty and generous...and also tried some of the cheese curds.  I liked the seasoning on the curds and liked that they used two different cheeses.  They were a ton better than those at A&W in my opinion.  Just a warning though; the burgers are so big and filling; there's not a lot of room left in the tummy for sides.  I was SO full.  The custard is smooth and silky; and I'm afraid to say Culver's may give Ritters a bit of competition.    You can get a quart for $5.99.  Every other quart you buy after that first one only costs you $3 each.  The price is extremely reasonable.  I was interested in the fact that you can get what they call regular sides and premium sides.  Anything from regular fries to sauteed green beans.

As the fattest nation on Earth; this burger must shine as a golden example to the reason. The cheeseburger that I ordered could have easily fed a Somalian village and walking back to the light rail I am sure my already high blood pressure shot several points higher. I pray I finish this review before I succumb...  I wouldn't recommend ordering the burger with tomatoes. Not that they were bad; but they create a sliding factor that detracts from the dining experience. There are two options - wear half of the burger on your shirt or wolf it down in an attempt not to wear said burger and as a result fail to be able to enjoy the dining experience.  The price of the meal is a little higher than most; but so are the portions. As I described; the burger is enormous; and I ordered a regular size fry. The fries are served in a paper cup and more fries dumped in the sack. Really it was overkill because by the time I engulfed the burger; I really didn't want any fries - but this is a review about the whole meal so for you; dear reader; I pushed on ever so slightly. The fries are good - Cajun flavor and spicy. Good - yes. \The best\"" as the advertisements proclaim? I wouldn't say so. In comparing Five Guys to another recently opened gourmet burger joint; SmashBurger's rosemary fries are far superior. Five Guys outranks SmashBurger In terms of dining room size and available seating. Plenty of place to sit and attempt not to wear the burger.   One thing I found as a huge distraction was the music. I don't want to sound like an old man; but turn that damn thing down! The radio was so loud it wasn't a pleasant experience. When you are trying to inhale a large cow cooked in 100% peanut oil; talking to your dining companion leaves limited opportunities. Say a few words and dive back in. What makes it annoying and difficult is that when you masterfully pull off this move; the partner continually says \""huh?\"".   Overall the burger was good and tasted grilled from the backyard. I know this will lose me points for being a fat guy and probably further lower my man-card status; but I don't think there needs to be two patties - one would suffice. The fries are too much too. I couldn't even finish the overflow in the bag; let alone touch the ones in the actual cup. For $11 for a burger; fries and drink ($5.59 burger; $2.59 regular Cajun fries; $2.19 large Cherry Coke)I felt like I wasted the fries and was so uncomfortable after gorging on the burger that I didn't enjoy the experience. Dare I say a smaller version of the meal would probably be a good opportunity for a future menu option.""",0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,Ive only been here once; but it'll probably be my last.

I would like to try the cajun ones in the future though just to see if they are any good.  The burger was very good as well.  I think they are a bit pricey for what you get but I'm still a fan.  I guess all those free toppings make up for the high cost of the burger a little bit.  Also; the patties are a bit thinner than I expected but were still pretty juicy and flavorful.  Our whole experience was a positive one and the cashier was very friendly and helpful.

As far as Mill Ave. is concerned; this is probably the best burger on the block because I really dislike FatBurger's burger.,0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,"I mean; it's good; but I wouldn't say that it is \all that!\""  The atmosphere is wonderful; prolly the reason I stayed with 4 stars instead of 3.  They employees are lively using fun voices to announce the pick-up numbers and are happy to assist with anything you may need.  The customer service aspect is top notch and they are happy to put all the fixings on your burgers for you.  Everything is a la carte so be prepared; it's on the pricey side.  I got a Bacon Cheeseburger and medium soda and it was $9.00.    Cajun fries are over-seasoned; but that's why I liked them so much.  The cajun seasoning was uber-delicious and so salty that it kept me going back for more.   Also; they have Mello-Yellow...yeah; I know; AWESOME!!  There are free peanuts; good food; and a fun atmosphere.  I went here with some friends after an ASU home game and enjoyed it.  Like I mentioned earlier; it's good; but it's not the best I've ever had.""",0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,Like In-N-Out with peanuts everywhere. Only twice the price. But without the drive-thru or the paper hats.,0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,Sooo; I went to Five Guys tonight for dinner.  I think I found my new burger place!  I got the bacon cheeseburger with the two patties with all of the toppings that are not by request only i.e. mayo; mustard; ketchup; pickles; lettuce; tomato; and grilled onion.  That burger was so juicy and flavorful!  I loved it!  The fries were fresh and plentiful and the cajun seasoning hit the spot!  I found it funny that there were so many people working behind the counter and there was only one girl working.  Sure; the place is a bit more pricey than in-n-out; but you get a lot more food as well.  The only reason I did not give this place 5 stars was because when I have a good burger; I need a strawberry shake to go with; and they do not sell shakes!!!  That sort of let me down a little bit; but other than that; I had absolutely no complaints.  I will definitely be returning to Five Guys!,0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,Here is my story on Five guys. Fries bathed in a peanut oil bubble bath will always make me happy. It reminds me of sunshine and puppies and all things that are pure and good in life. Five guys uses peanut oil and I am all for that.   I took the advice of a reviewer and got a little guy (with cheese and bacon) and It was more than plenty with the fries and drink.  Peanuts while you wait. I was a bit amused by the text on the side of the box warning not to remove from the shop (on account of peanut allergies) Legal posturing for liability purposes always gets me...but good form.  I like that all the toppings you want are included at no additional charge. LIke mushrooms and grilled onions and about a dozen other options. That in a way justifies the higher prices; because while yeah there is the lamo who just wants ketchup; most will take advatage of that shiz and pile it high...yeah; like I did.  The coke fountain was seriously out of Star Trek The Next Generation.  I watched it... don't judge--if you got the reference you did too. I'm pretty sure Picard got his Earl Grey out of the same stinkin machine.   Touch Screen. I push Coke. A dozen new icons come up. Would I like; Cherry Coke; Lime Coke; Lemon Coke; Orange Coke; Vanilla Coke? Just Coke thanks; I add my citrus the old fashioned way...from a piece of citrus.   Bag was greasy; so I know I am going to like it. Yeah I did.  Go. You will feel a bit guilty; so eat a salad for dinner and run an extra mile. But do it.,0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,I was not overly impressed with 5 guys.  We have only been to this place one time.  The guy who took our order was impatient and unfriendly when we asked questions about the menu.    My burger was extremely wet which caused the entire thing to fall apart making it impossible to eat.  I also don't understand why they tell you that you can have anything that you want on your burger; but give such skimpy amounts.  ONE mushroom on a burger does not count as a topping.    I agree that the fry order is strange.  It's fine for two people to share; but I can't imagine going solo for lunch and ordering such a massive amount of fries.    I don't get the whole peanuts-in-a-burger-joint thing.......peanuts and burgers?  Prices are a bit on the higher side for such typical burgers.  Can't get out of there for under $10 person.  If the burgers were fantastic; I wouldn't mind the pricing; but they aren't that great.    Smashburger will continue to get my business over 5 Guys.,0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,Soggy french fries; an okay burger and that's about it. Oh; and it will cost about 10 bucks.,0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,An alright burger joint with peanuts galore.  They use peanut oil for everything. I ordered a hamburger; reg Cajun fries; and reg drink; totaling at $10.   Result; I got a burger with double hand made patties with onions mushrooms pickles etc sandwiched with a sesame seeded set of buns. Reminds me of well crafted homemade burger. It was good but for the price in and out burgers knocks five guys out of the competition. Delicious regardless and I'd eat again.,0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,From the stale peanuts at the beginning of the line where it starts. Then for $13 bucks; forget it. I can eat for same price for two people and be IN and OUT burger,0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,Went here on vacation. This place is really good. Huge burgers.  My only problem with 5 guys is the price of the burgers. A bacon burger is 5.60. That is with no fries or a drink. The fries cost 2 something and they give you a ton. You could share the fries among three friends.  Five guys has around 20 different toppings for your burger. Great clean place. This location also has outdoor seating.,0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,Went here on vacation. This place is really good. Huge burgers.  My only problem with 5 guys is the price of the burgers.

Greg would string me up by my toenails and make me repent for my burger sins if he knew I was reviewing his favorite place as just a three star burger joint. But I can't abide paying ten to twelve bucks for a fast food burger; fries and a drink. That's crazy cakes.   Granted the burger is juicy perfection; grilled to order with as many custom toppings as your hardening arteries can handle. They have two in particular that get me salivating every time: grilled mushrooms and onions. That alone should warrant a fourth star; especially since they don't cost an extra couple bucks a pop like most places. But it's still a six freakin' dollar burger. If they hadn't plastered their walls with newspaper reviews exalting how cheap their eats were; I would probably be a bit more accommodating; but more than ten bucks for a fast foodie burger meal just ain't on.  I do also like that they offer a mini version of their two patty big madre burger; for the wimps like me out there. Regardless; I would recommend keeping the foil around your burger and peeling it away like the burritos from Chipoodle. This will guarantee that all those slippery little grilled mushroom and onion tidbits stay in place; because they're seriously too good to get away.   The french fries are also in the style that I like; freshly fried up with the bejeezus salted out of them. Ten billion times better than the fresh but somehow still super bland and lifeless matchsticks that In & Out serves. The Cajun style fries are just sprinkled with seasoned salt. A bit of a let down from what I was expecting but a nice change in pace since it's usually curly fries that get the seasoned salt treatment. Also if you're a limey barstard like me you can grab a bottle of malt vinegar from the side counter and use it to drown your fries. So good.  I also dig on the free peanuts. I realize this is a polarizing issue considering the risk of nut allergies out there; but I like it. When I was a kid I used to judge the caliber of an establishment by whether or not I could throw peanut shells on the ground. Sadly; that has changed very little with the years because I still get a kick out of doing it.   Alright. I've talked myself into it. It's getting an extra star. Damn your scrumptious fare; Five Guys. Your hypnotic grease has me entranced.,0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,I really want to give this place four stars.

The burger was good. Not great; not bland; just okay. My biggest hang up with this restaurant are the prices! Skip the beverage... it's very over priced. I was also not impressed with the fries- regular or cajun. They were pretty average as well. Stick with the burger and skip the rest is my suggestion to you.,0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,I was first introduced to Five Guys by some friends down in Jacksonville; FL.  I then ran into it again at the DCA airport while delayed for a flight home once and it helped me to be less crotchity towards the gate agents.  Then I realized that these Five Guys were all around me as I suddenly ran into one on Walnut Street in Philly and then another out near Lester;PA. The one on Mill Ave that recently opened echoes the same simple goodness that the others do.  Good burgers and fries.  I actually like them a little more than In and Out Burger but that could be because of my east coast bias.  I think I like most that it is like a burger you or I could make and serve with nothing too fancy.  A little pricey; I still don't mind because of the meat quality.  Mounds of fries are a signature.  I give them 4 of 5 because I do think they could do a few bargain deals on the price.,0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,Five Guys is pretty new on the scene on Mill and fits in very well with the college style and crowd that it will cater to.  This place is by no means a gourmet restaurant; but they put out decent food at a decent price. The inside is very well lit and very clean with white tiled walls with red highlights and free peanuts for snacking on.  Service is quick and friendly with food being made as it is ordered. My burger was well cooked; but not dry and overdone; well prepared and still juicy.  The toppings are very fresh and can be picked to suit with a large variety.  Being able to just pick and choose your toppings to your heart's desire is kind of a neat aspect of this place and gives the customer the ability to customize their burger.  The fries were the weakest part of the meal since they were a bit on the soggy side and left room for improvement.  I did like the choice of regular fries or cajun; which gave the fries a bit more flavor and taste and actually bumped up fries a bit.  However; I really like my fries to be a bit more crispy and less soggy/limp.,0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,"I'm not sure who the 5 guys are; nor do I care; but on my way to the airport we dropped in for a quick (10 minute) bite before hitting the jet stream.  Damn; didn't we just eat In N Out like 3 hours ago? Yeah; but they serve Hot Dogs here. Yea! Okay; so I wasn't helping my diet any; but hey; I'm on vacation. No; not really; but whatever.  One hot dog please! What would you like on it? BACON! and?... Wow; tons to choose from!!! I'll have onions; mustard and JALAPENOS!  My friends ordered a burger and a grilled cheese and I sat back and watched as the \guys\"" made all our food from scratch.  Everything was tasty and the fries were IMHO perfect. The price was good; the portions good; the staff were good and the place was clean.  Yup; I'd do it again""",0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,After hearing that this place was not only the talk of the town but also our esteemed President's favorite; I figured I'd give it a try.  Sadly; I'm not impressed.  There was nothing wrong with my dinner; but I expect a burger and fries costing $11+ to be more than just ok.  In the end though; Five Guys tastes like a neighborhood cookout.  The burger was fine--nothing unexpected; and the fries tasted homemade.    They seem to be going for a less-is-more motif in the store.  Unfortunately; it just comes off as cold and cheap--In-N-Out does the clean 50s diner look a lot better; and Smashburger does the upscale burger menu better.  It won't kill you; but you'll feel like you got overcharged.,0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,After hearing that this place was not only the talk of the town but also our esteemed President's favorite; I figured I'd give it a try.

I was immediately impressed with how many people they had working; I counted 14 just behind the counter. They had classic rock playing so loud you could barely hear them call out order numbers and the people behind the counter were yelling and laughing. It's a pretty fun experience for lunch.  I ordered the little bacon cheeseburger; cajun fries and regular drink. The burger was decent (not In and Out quality; but pretty good). I really liked that they let you load up on your choice of toppings (I got grilled onions; mushrooms; lettuce; tomato and pickles) they also had green peppers; jalapeno peppers; bbq and A1 sauce. I was a little disappointed with the price as $10.24 seemed a bit high.   They didn't have shakes  which was a major let down. All in all it was pretty good; but not much better than Fat Burger which is just down the block on Mill. I'll be interested to see how they far in the long run.,0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,Little expensive for a burger and fries; but it is a quality meal. Cajun fries are good and its always fun to watch the people try to figure out the soda machines. Has some hot dogs for kids as well. Even though the say all topping are free; when you are paying 8.00 for just a burger they are not free.,0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,bomb burgers and fairly cheap,0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,I had heard about the growth of this chain and wondered what they're doing different; now I can say been there; done that.    Not overly impressed; over priced; greasy food and the burger was just ok.  Higher quality of meats but not for the price.  The fries were horribly greasy and ended up throwing those out.    I took my nephews and they wouldn't  eat the fries either and they ate their hot dog and hamburger without feed back good or bad.    Don't need to go back to this location or any other for that matter..  Limited menu: missing the wow factor.,0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,"I grew up in Kentucky and had never heard of five guys.  All my friends here were soooo excited when they saw the \coming soon\"" sign on mill ave. So; as a serious burger lover; i got my hopes up and couldnt wait to check it out.  Sorry to say; i wasnt impressed.  I realize its a chain and those are always a let down but the hype that preceeded my visit definately killed it for me.  For what it is;  the prices are pretty outrageous; the wait is pretty long; and the employees were pretty much a-holes.  I think it came out to about 11 bucks for a burger; fries and drink.  And no the peanuts did not cushion the blow.  For the money Id take Chuckbox over here any day.""",0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,"Jenny R and I popped in here this afternoon. I've walked by a few times and noticed the long lines and crowds inside. I had to see what the fuss was about. I'm very impressed. This is my new favorite burger spot. They have normal size burgers (i.e. huge) as well as mini versions. I got a mini because I'm watching my figure and it was the perfect size burger for me. The burger comes naked as a Jaybird. If you want something on it (and they have quite a list of toppings) you have to specify. The burger was one of the best I've ever had in my life. Perhaps it was the grilled onions and mushrooms.  The cajun fries were smothered in spice and made my tongue sweat. I liked it! (\Small\"" must mean \""enormous.\"" Get a small and you can easily split it was a friend or two.) Five Guys wasn't any more pricey than any other burger spot around town. The mini burger and small cajun fries came to $6.50 ish. (No drink for me. I only drink water; and that's always free.) I'm only going here for burgers from now on. I'm very pleased to see this on Mill Ave.""",0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,"I have now tried the three new burger chains that have moved into the Tempe area.  Five Guys; Smashburger and Fatburger.  Five Guys was the worst of the three.  $11 for a burger; fries and drink!  The burger fell apart when I picked it up and didn't taste that good.  The fries had the most burnt pieces of fries in an order of fries I have ever had/seen.  (I worked in fast food in my youth and would never had given out this order of fries to a customer.)  The drink was colored water.  I went for ice tea at the self serve drink area and tried two different types of ice tea and both were like drinking water.  I should have expected that as a light on the ice tea machine was flashing and I saw employees look at it but just walk away.  Also; one of the two ice/soda machines had a sign taped on it advising customers to use the other machine.  (This location is pretty new and I saw an armoured car make a pickup while I was there.  Well at the prices they charge; no surprise at how much money they are taking in.  Perhaps Five Guys would like to take some of that money and fix the ice tea and the one ice/soda machine.)  I didn't even go during the lunch or dinner rush; 2:00 p.m.!  Also; after I paid for my order; I selected a small table and left some napkins and a copy of a weekly newspaper that I planned to read while eating on the table.  I then went to get my colored water (ice tea) and went back to my table to wait for my order to be called.  When I returned to my table; my napkins and newspaper were gone!  Yes; I found the newspaper in the trash can by the table.

Besides the odd addition of peanuts; the menu is very basic like an In and Out Burger....but about 3 times the price!  The menu doesn't say anywhere that the regular burger has 2 patties....which would be helpful when ordering for someone that isn't trying to practice for a food eating competition!  The burgers tasted good; but they weren't anything special that I would go back for.  Besides; two burgers and a side of fries was $20...there are much better burgers out there with comparable prices.,0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,Freshly prepared burgers just the way you want it. Nice fresh cut french fries with some of the potato skin for flavor. Definitely go there with an appetite. More expensive than In n Out burger but worth it. Only down side is having to deal with parking on Mill.,0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,For a place that's supposed to be all about great burgers; at least this location falls far short of the mark. I ordered a little bacon cheese burger and fries (as an aside; I find it annoying that they only offer one size of fries; not on an economic level - as the cost for the size they offer is reasonable; but on a wasteful level as sometimes I just want some dries and not a pound of fries). Needless to say; after a reasonable wait; I got my food and upon opening the wrapper; found the bun waterlogged and shriveled as if it had been made some time ago. I'm mot sure how this could be however; as I ordered a specific set of toppings which seemed to be present. Anyhow; with the first bite; the Burger self-destructed and left me with a burger-salad I was forced to eat like an animal. The ingredients; except the horrible bun which caused the whole problem; were good and fresh; and the fries - although too numerous; were great. I have been to another five guys location in the area and this was not my experience there. This location needs to fix a few things to get it right; and the average three stars I saw on their overview probably gets it about right. Maybe this sort of sloppy preparation works for a $10 lunch for a college kid; but for me it was unacceptable.,0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,The owners of this chain sure know how to hype up an average tasting burger. The food is not bad nor good; it is just average. Its food you can cook at home. The cheese is that cheap fake cheese; the meat sucks. The price is way too much.

I order the regular size and even it is too big.  Not only do they fill the cup; but then they also fill the brown bag that the cup of fries is poured into!  This is the first place where I saw the cool soda machine that I've now seen in a few other places.  But I love that you can pick your own drinks from so many different flavors!  Although; I get cherry sprite every time!  Yum!!!  Every time I have been here; there's always been good seating and everything has been clean.  My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that it's a bit overpriced.,0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,So since everyone is comparing this place to In-N-Out I will base my review on a comparison of the two.  1. the atmosphere. Pretty similar to In-N-Out. It's got a classic burger joint kinda feel. Although it's very loud. Some coworkers and I went at lunch and we had a hard time hearing each other. It was very busy and the music was cranked.   2. the burger. Okay; so it is more expensive than In-N-Out but it's much bigger. I got the small and it was still a pretty thick patty plus you get all the toppings you want. I like that there are so many options so you can customize your burger. I got mine with cheese; lettuce; tomato and mayo. I thought the meat was flavorful; the veggies were fresh and the bun was fresh too.  3. the fries. WAY better than In-N-Out. I've never really understood why people think the fries at In-N-Out are so great. Yeah; they're fresh but I think they are a little bland. Five Guys fries are also fresh but have a much better flavor. They are cut much bigger and the portion is huge! We each ordered our own fries (all of us were Five Guys virgins) and not one of us finished the order. One guy ordered a large and it was insane. The five of us probably could have shared a large. Or at least a large and a small. We threw away so many fries it was redonkulous.   Overall; my group left Five Guys stuffed and satisfied. I think it's just as good as In-N-Out if not better because of their awesome fries.,0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,eh.  first of all; this place had been hyped up to me by a couple of people(hubby included) for several days. add that to the fact that parking on Mill's a b*tch; and you will realize why this was such a let-down for me.  now; we'll begin with the pros: *free peanuts while you wait *delicious cajun fries *malt vinegar  ...that's about it.  the burger was kind of dry and; I suspect; would have been about as good as; say; McDonalds; had I not added my plethora of toppings. the service took forever(and it was nearly empty in there); and their sh*t is EXPENSIVE.  Lenny's; in Glendale; has them beat. hands down.,0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,"Small burger; Small fry; Small drink = $10  Burger -- Tomato and Lettuce were fresh and good.  Bun \collapsed\"" and became that gooey fake white bread bun that you can see where your hand grabbed the burger.  The patty/cheese was fine; I guess...but I didn't get any real flavor from it.  Fries -- They use \""real\"" potatoes; but the fries are flavorless.  But at least they're greasy!  Soda -- Kudos for a good selection; including two diet-caffeine-free choices; something I've never seen before!  I'm not a fanboy of In-n-Out; but at least they know to charge a reasonable price for their food (which is much better than Five Guys).  In summary...this place is the emperor with no clothes.  And they want you to know that lots of newspapers around the country think they're great...the reviews are all over the walls.  Perhaps they're trying to convince patrons that their tastebuds and pocketbook are lying...""",0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,My dining partner and I ended up here for lunch because our original destination was closed. After ordering; we dove into the unlimited free peanuts.. so far so good. However; once we got into the burger and fries; our experience began to go downhill.   Maybe it's unfair; but I compare every burger I eat to In-N-Out. This cheeseburger just didn't measure up. It wasn't bad; but not great either. We also shared an order of the Cajun fries; which weren't anything special. The worst was right after we finished eating. My dining partner and I both had the feeling you get when you eat junk food that didn't even satisfy you; but instead leaves you feeling crappy.    Another thing- I spent $5 for a cup of water and a small cheeseburger. I could get a cheeseburger; fries and a small drink at In-N-Out for the same price.   Needless to say; I will not be returning to Five Guys.,0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,Five Guys has one of my favorite fast food burgers in the Valley.  Their standard cheeseburger is 2/3 of a pound (HUGE!); very delicious; and well-priced.  This location; and probably others; has the high-tech soda fountain machine that lets you add flavors to your Coke like lime and vanilla - pretty cool.  The only problem with this particular Five Guys is its location on Mill Avenue.  Metered parking nearby is hard to come by so; when you go here; you also have to factor in the walk from your car and the cost of parking.,0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,Five Guys has one of my favorite fast food burgers in the Valley.

Metered parking nearby is hard to come by so; when you go here; you also have to factor in the walk from your car and the cost of parking.,0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,I've been to Five Guys twice now; first on opening day when I got a small burger; fries and a drink for $10.  I thought the burger was very good.  I liked it better then In 'N Out just because of the toppings.  I like more of an exotic burger and Five Guys had plenty of toppings to choose from that made it just the way I like it.  The cajun fries were very good; but they give you way too many.  I'd rather see a smaller portion for less money.    Yesterday I went again and this time ordered a Cheese Hot Dog.  The hot dog was very good; Kosher; cut down the middle and grilled.  The cheese was a slice of American cheese which was better then the liquid crap most places use; but better yet would have been grated cheese.  I also got grilled onions; mushrooms; and jalepenos on top; but didn't get many toppings; maybe because of the limited space on a hot dog; but a little disappointing.  Overall I think it's really good and I would have given it a high rating if it was a little cheaper and if they used grated cheese.  Everyone working there was very friendly and love the classic rock music they play.,0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,Good; fast service; and the place is always clean.  It's a little expensive for fast food though.,0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,Five Guys offers a decent burger; but it's definitely overcooked--they brag about serving them well done and there's no argument here: that's what they are. But I much prefer the flavor of Smashburger's meat. Five Guys seemed rather devoid of meaningful seasoning; or if it was there; it was killed in the well-doneing.   I also didn't really like that it comes out as two carelessly charred mini-patties; instead of one; nicely cooked and seasoned burger.  As far as Mill-area burgers are concerned; I'm at the following: 1.Smashburger  2. Chuckbox 3.  In N Out 4. Five Guys 5. Fatburger  And Chuckbox and Smashburger are awfully close. I've been a HUGE fan of Chuckbox for forever; so many I like the newness of Smashburger; but damn is it tasty. I also prefer the Smashfries to Chuckbox's fries; but I think I prefer 5 Guys' fries to both of them.  Finally; the price is obnoxious. You're not getting that much in the way of a burger for $11 (drink + fries + cheeseburger). You get a MOUNTAIN of fries; but I don't NEED that many fries. You also get to top it with just about anything; but I don't want to subsidize other people's toppings. Let me pay $2 less to get mine with lettuce; ketchup; and mayo.  Overall a meh burger. Not great; but better than Fatburger; if I don't want to walk to College for great burgerness.  Oh; as for atmosphere; it was like a club in there. I really don't need to be bombarded with music at lunch when I'm going to talk to someone. I hate shouting and the few times when the song would switch and the grill would quiet was like the eye of the storm. Turn that shit down.,0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,This visit was my first to 5 Guys and it was pretty okay. I have heard the In n Out/5 Guys comparisons and I am on team InO but I always welcome a competing burger. Ordering was pretty simple. I had a little bacon cheeseburger with some basic toppings and cajun style fries. It took a little while for our food to come out; which was a sign of them making it fresh as you can see into the kitchen. The fries were okay (I did enjoy the cajun option); the burger was okay - neither blew me away; especially for the price; but I wouldn't object to coming back.,0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,My 5 guys experience was always on the East Coast (Maryland). I was excited that a location was coming just a few miles from me. I really enjoy the burgers and fries. I've held off long enough; but the time had finally to come to enjoy the 5 guys burger once again.  I'm very shocked with all the sour reviews low scores. I think folks in AZ and out west are still getting to know 5 guys and haven't fully appreciated the goodness.   Locally; I would only take a Lobby's burger over 5 guys. In/Out is close. Each their own.....  5 guys is still a great burger. I will admit the burger was a bit below the taste that I had in Maryland. I think it may have been the bun.  The fries tasted just the same; which I really enjoy. The fries are cut there and fresh. A regular fries can easily feed 2 people. Don't go for the larger size; you'll regret the cost and having so many extra fries.  I enjoy the simple menu and you get to decide what toppings you want on your burger. There are several options to choose from.    The free peanuts is a nice touch to snack on before your meal is ready..I always enjoy a handful.  With this location; the biggest issues were the floors were dirty and the music being played was VERY loud. I'm at a place to eat; not a rock show or club.  My wife was super excited there was caffeine free diet coke in the fountain.,0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,After reading many reviews for places to eat in Tempe; I decided I wanted a burger. Chose Five Guys because of a friend of a friend  raving over it.   Walked in and read the 30 signs they had all around the place then finally made my way to order. I ordered a cheeseburger with onion; lettuce; and mustard. My partner ordered a bacon cheeseburger with lettuce; tomato; grilled onion; ketchup;and mustard. We each had a drink and shared a small Cajun fry. We asked the cashier how big each patty was and he said 3.3 to 3.5oz's.  Food was quick. Fries were small but plentiful; actually; we only ate the the extras at the bottom of the bag. The cup was still full. Anyways I started on my burger and found it to be okay. It was good but that's it. The burger was juicy but not flavorful; I am glad that I added the cheese which made it a little better. I really didn't like the seasoned fries; they were better when I dipped them in hot sauce. My partners burger was of course messy but the bacon was good; crunchy and had a smokey flavor. It was good; definitely better than mine but nothing I would crave. Overall; I wasn't blown especially being on Mill; closing at 7 and being overpriced.,0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,Five Guys... What cannot be said about this place?  I stumbled upon it last October in Saratoga Springs; NY; where we decided to eat at Chipotle for lack of anything else recognizable.  I saw the Five Guys next door; and decided to try it out instead of having another bland Chipotle burrito.  Needless to say; when I ran into another Five Guys in Ithaca two days later; I knew I had to eat there for lunch.  Since they opened here in the Valley a month or so ago; I've had to restrain myself.  If it weren't for the guaranteed heart attack that would occur were I to dine at Five Guys twice a day; I think I would probably do so.    I should point out that; before I ate at Five Guys; In-N-Out was my favorite fast food burger joint.  But the food at Five Guys is simply superior.  The burgers are tastier and have more options; and the fries are an order of magnitude better.    The only issue I have with this place is that the price is admittedly steep; but when you consider how much food you get; it's not too unreasonable.  If you stick to the Little Hamburger; which is still probably more filling than a normal fast food burger; you could probably get a meal for inside $8; but that meal will still be more substantial than a normal $6 fast food burger meal.  On the upside; however; the price might have the fortunate side effect of discouraging rowdy kids who could care less about the quality of their burger.,0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,"I'm with Jason C. on this one.  Given the price for the cheeseburger I bought; I was a little \Meh;\"" about it.  It did taste pretty good; it was pretty bomb but it I've had cheaper and better.  The fries; yeah; are pretty damn good too.    The decor is alright.  The line to get your food and the actual dining area is divided by sacks of potatoes.  Yes; it's tacky but I thought that was cool.  Oh; and free peanuts.  If you ride a bike; DO NOT use the bike rack right out in front.  Don't do it.  You see all that bird shit everywhere?

The Zagat reviewers that called this one of the best burgers should be put into a rocket and shot into the sun.  It would be alright if you were looking for a cheap fast food burger; but the price implies it's much more.  The bacon cheeseburger is $6; fries are $5; drinks over $2.  The burger is over-cooked and a bit on the dry side.  They use some kind of runny goo they call \cheese\"" but is pretty nasty both in flavor and consistency.

Five guys is one of the few things I missed about living in Virginia; and my first meal there on the day they opened was totally worth the wait.    Some points to consider:   They aren't cheap. They aren't fancy or foo-foo.  They only serve a few things.  But everything they serve is fantastic; and well worth the price.  For those complaining about the burger being too big; get the little version. For those complaining about it being unhealthy; go buy a salad elsewhere. For those complaining about it being expensive; consider the sheer volume of food you're getting for the money.  They don't nickel and dime you with extra toppings or add-ons; you pay one price and get anything you want; and enough to split between two people if you're not able to take it down yourself.

A burger fries and drink are what; $10-12?  BUt I can go to In n Out and get superior fries; a superior burger; all while watching them smash potatoes while I wait in the drive thru all for $6?!?!?!  Please explain to me why this place exists again.      This is what you get with massive corporate food chains.  I expected nothing less.  I've tried it twice; won't even go back.  I encourage everyone to go here though; I don't need a longer line at places I enjoy! ;),0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,Walking in to Five Guys; I was rather excited; and was looking forward to my experience. I have never been to a Five Guys before; so this was something new. My first reaction upon opening the doors was the music was blaring. Too loud; at least. The music was classic rock; which I don't mind. After walking up and reviewing the easily understood menu and waiting in line for a few minutes; someone took our order. The order taker seemed like she was having a long day; not seeming very interested in the customer. While taking the order; one could clearly see the kitchen. It seemed kind of like In-N-Out; but everyone was moving much slower. It was as if everyone was moving in slow motion.  Much to my dismay; they did not offer Dr. Pepper; my favorite soft drink. I was surprised that they offered other lesser known drinks; but not Dr. Pepper? Come on. After waiting about 6 or 7 minutes; my food arrived in a bag. A bag? Really? I was planning on eating inside; not take out. Even McDonald's does better than that. Digging through the bag I first took out the fries; which were in a cup; and I took a bite. My first impression of the fries was they were nothing special; and too salty. I like salt on my fries as it adds flavor; but there was simply too much salt. As a result; in addition to the fact that the serving was quite large; I finished only about half of my fries.  Now onto the burger. I paid about $10 for my meal; so I was thinking to myself that this better be the best burger I have ever tasted in a long time. Unwrapping the product in its tin foil wrapping; I noticed that the presentation of the burger was sub par. The burger did not look appetizing; at all. Almost disgusting; as a matter of fact. The cheese was dripping over the bun; and I couldn't even see all the ingredients on the burger. Taking my first bite; it didn't taste bad. A pretty classic American burger taste; I must say. It did taste rather close to Wendy's.   Upon finishing my meal; I was not impressed. My stomach felt greasy; and I felt the need to go hike a mountain a couple times; which I did; as Tempe Butte is close by. I felt my stomach almost on the point of rejecting it; it was that greasy. Seriously. Overall; Five Guys is way to expensive; unbelievably greasy; and makes your stomach cringe. The atmosphere is nice though; thus the two stars.   If you had to choose between Five Guys and In-N-Out; INO is the clear winner in every category.,0sNQHGJCb6ckMW3P_J3oXA,A friend of mine had hyped this place up for the past week and so I was definitely excited to take it for a test drive. When we arrived; it was during lunch hours and the place was pretty busy; but we walked right up to the front and placed our order. I went with a bacon cheeseburger; and let me tell you; this thing was no joke! I asked for extra crispy bacon; mayo; and ketchup and everything was prepared as I had requested. Lots of flavor; two thick and  juicy patties; and enough grease to power an alternative fuel vehicle...quite tasty. Between three of us; we split a small order of Cajun fries and they were pretty decent. The thicker the cut of the fry; the soggier they were; but not bad. Our food was prepared quickly; and the service was good for being as busy as they were. As mentioned; this isn't the most cost effective meal if you're on a budget; but for the quality of the food I'm ok with that. Will definitely be back when I need a burger fix for lunch. Nice work; Five Guys.,eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,This place isn't bad; though I'm not sure it's a place I'd visit all the time.   The burgers are cheap; but they're a bit bland in flavor and certainly are messy. They also like to make these burgers tall.    The fries are great. And the service was friendly. I only wish the burgers had more flavor.,eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,I am a fat body.  Not that I'm morbidly obese; but I doubt I have much muscle left on my carcass; and that most of it is now jiggle.  I'm glad I still have some muscle in my arms though.  Because I needed it to lift one of the most satisfying hamburgers I have had IN A LONG TIME!!!!  I love this burger.  The ground beef is so orgasmically delicious!!  I almost screamed obscenities out loud from the joy that coursed over my taste buds.  I had the double with provolone and spicy peppers.  I don't think I'm ready to eat anything bigger than that; because 3 hours later; I'm still full.  The burgers are definitely 5 stars; but it's a bit pricey and in a pretty weird location; so I took one away.  Oh well.  It won't stop me from driving across town for another.,eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,"For Arizona; this is not a half bad Chicago style food. Although one of the employees said that they use Vienna beef hotdogs; I dont believe him. It didn't taste like 'em. The Italian beef combo was pretty true to the OG; however; the hot giardiniera was extremely salty. The chili cheese--Cheap; salty; greasy; fried; processed \cheese\""; spicy chili (basically how it should taste)--bomb.""",eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,I had lunch here the other day.  It was a bit before the noon lunch rush so it wasn't too crowded.  You could tell they were gearing up for it so I can tell they get pretty busy.  So come early to avoid waiting with throngs of school kids that undoubtedly come from the high school next door.    I like that their menu isn't huge with zillions of burger combos and other options.  It was pretty straight forward.  I had the standard burger; fries and a drink.  Everything looks like it is pretty much cooked to order so it took a few minutes to get my food which was ok.  The cashier guy who looked suspiciously like Ray Liotta was very friendly and working like crazy so I'm pretty sure he was the manager if not the owner.  The burger was thick; juicy and cooked perfectly.  It was a tad bit greasy but that made it that much more delicious.  The fries were also pretty good.  They are crinkle cut with just the right amount of crispiness on the outside and fluffiness on the inside.  I wasn't exactly sure what to do with the little cup of sauce they give you so I used it for my fries and my burger.  I think it was some chipotle mayo stuff.  It was pretty good but an odd thing to put on burgers and/or fries.  This place isn't exactly cheap but it is worth it.  I can't think of a better fast food burger/fries in the area.  I would return to get the burger but I really want to try their Italian beef as well.,eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Of all the new additions (Smash Burger; Five Guys) to the already flourishing Tempe burger scene (Fatburger; Chuck Box; Ted's); Lobby holds its own with a combination of taste and price.   The burgers are freshly made; well-topped and well-cooked. At $5; that's a great deal - and a spectacular alternative to fast food.  I'm personally partial to the Chuck Box; but if it wasn't for the location; Lobby might knock the Box down.,eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Yesterday was my third time back and I have to bump them up to five stars now. I had the Italian beef this time and it was probably the best I have ever had; certainly better to my taste than Al's in Chicago. The service just keeps getting better and better also. Prices can get a little high when you start to add things--for instance peppers or cheese--but still worth it.,eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,I've worked my way pretty much through the menu and I haven't been disappointed ever.  Discovered this place because of a McClintock High Football discount card.  Go Chargers!   Burgers - Fantastic (I like adding grilled onions and extra sauce) a bit pricey but it's still worth it.  Juicy every time.     Dogs - authentic real dog with the right flavors for real Chicago Dog fan.  I think I could go for two.  Fries - always fresh and good but I'm not crinkle cut fry person.  Get the fry sauce and I like adding just a little Ketchup.  Italian Beef - awesome but eat quickly as it's so juicy it starts to fall apart at times.  I figure if its falling anywhere it should be into my mouth.  Combo (beef w/ sausage too!) - HELLO! We will meet again.  Sorry I was talking to my food again.  This I tried after a Chicago native advised me to try it and shabam it's awesome.,eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Great place to grab a burger in Tempe.  Great food and you CANNOT beat their prices.

Here's the order:  \""An Italian Beef; hot; with provolone & hot giardiniera; full dip;\"" plus a fries.  Pretty soon here came my sandwich.  This baby has been completely dipped in au jous; so it' more of a knife & fork sandwich than one you eat with your hands; unless you don't mind getting them all wet.  Either way; it's really good!

Location- It's a small space in a strip mall but that's not the draw of this great restaurant.    Food- Awesome; large burgers; Chicago style dogs (from an owner who is a Chicago native); Italian beef and a variety of sausages.  I had the double bacon burger tonight and it was a big portion of amazing; fresh veggies and good quality beef.  You know when you have a cheap burger where even the pickles are gross; well here the pickles are thick cut and great; the bacon is really tasty and everything else is perfect.    Note on food- They also have a burger challenge where you have to eat a 9 patty burger in 10 minutes to get your picture on the wall and a t-shirt.  I haven't tried this yet but want to soon.  Owner- The owner was working when we were there and he takes real pride in his food and his product.  He talked about how he fresh makes all of his fries to order because he never wants people to have soggy fries. He also gave us a big basket of fresh fries for free because he didn't want to throw them away and would not serve them to a later customer.   More reviews to come as I try more of their great food!,eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Love the burgers....however I just want to drink water...so I get a tiny cup..ask if I may have a bigger cup..no that is our policy...seriously.

I'm sitting in the restaurant now; and feel the way I did when I had a new crush in high school: giddy.   I can't exactly place it...maybe it's the generous portion of crinkle cut fries made to perfection or the creamy cheese sauce drizzled all over them. Maybe it was the fresh tasting burger; the lightly toasted sesame seed bun it came on; the cheddar cheese; or the special sauce that brought it all together. It's one of those burgers where you take the first bite and can't put it down...you don't even want to stop to use the ketchup you brought to the table specifically for the burger; it just disappears before you can realize what happened; and all you're left with is the fun music and fresh; clean atmosphere as you sit in the restaurant; wowed; and fantasizing about the next time you'll be back.   I'm definitely coming back to try the Italian Beef and a shake. This place reminds me of home. Don't pass up an opportunity to have a great tasting burger for a reasonable price.,eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,"The website boasts 100% Grass-fed Iowa beef; the prices were reasonable and the delivery guy was very nice and personable. The rest of my experience was absolutely awful. First off; the delivery service is run through another company. Who outsources delivery drivers? Evidently these folks do; and you pay for it with patience and money. We ordered three of the same burgers (bacon burgers with added cheddar); and modified one to have no onion and no sauce. We also ordered one order of cheese fries with added peppers; and two plain orders of fries on the side. The website was fickle and we had to put in the correct combinations of \Letter-perfect\"" street addresses; which was aggravating but manageable. Our order showed up precisely on time; the delivery guy looked stressed and hands over a half-soaked white bag covered in what he claims is cheese sauce and says \""The fries busted.\"" So I scurry off to the kitchen with our food to inspect the damages and the cheese fries are fine; the cheese sauce couldn't have run all over the inside of the bag because it was ice cold. Anyone who has handled cold cheese sauce knows it's like salty silly putty when it's cold. No; it is in fact the sauce from the burger that nobody ordered on the side. We just plain didn't want the burger sauce; but we got in anyway; all over our entire order. The delivery guy calls the restaurant and tells them what happened; they say they will replace the entire order but that it will take another hour to get back to us. We called the restaurant and the girl who picked up the phone was rude; abrupt and blamed the delivery guy for throwing the food around. He blamed her for packaging it badly. She showed no care or concern for our complaint and couldn't get us off the phone fast enough. We asked to speak to a manager and she says \""I can take a message\"". Oh; so now the underpaid help is fielding complaints for the manager or is it that she has no intention of doing anything about it but wiping her a** with the complaint slip? I think it's the latter. She really was the most awful representative for a dining establishment I have ever encountered. I have bar-tended and served in high end and low end restaurants for ten years and I have to say; she has NO business being in the food business. She should be relieved of her *obviously* so-stressful position at the front counter of Lobby's burgers and fries. Then; when we hang up with that one; the manager calls us and sensing that he is unable to make things right as they have gone so so terribly wrong; he hangs up on us! Awesome customer service abounds here! So yes; what little corner I could taste of the burger was absolutely delicious; though 99.9% of it went right in the trash. I wish I had gotten an edible order so we could have enjoyed all of it. It's sad; really; a whole meal wasted because someone put sauce in a bag that we didn't even want. I would consider trying it again; but the girl on the phone; the manager and the delivery service make me really think twice before going back.""",eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Decent burger.  Good bun.  Average fries (but I guess it's what you like sorta thing).    Price seemed okay; but food prices everywhere for med-fast food seem to keep going up.   Saying all that; my baseline is Red Robin; but that's just what I like.    Very friendly counter girl; did nice job; very welcoming.  Checked in on my meal to make sure it was okay.   I'll be back to try other items on the menu.,eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,I love this place! The owner is an awesome guy who's usually there during the day; making sure all the food is wonderful. They make some of the best chili I've ever had. The beef sandwiches (I get them with hot peppers and cheddar) and the cheeseburgers are must haves. All the food is cooked fresh within sight! I crave this place on a daily basis and I usually end up going 3-4 times a week. The prices aren't bad; a little pricey for myself (a broke; hungry college student) but the portions are always generous. I would take a star off because they don't have milkshakes (and I would sure love a good milkshake with this food) but everything else is so good that giving only four stars wouldn't do it justice!,eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,He forgot my cheese but it was still the best; cheap burger and fries ever. I will go back.,eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,In a small unassuming shop in Tempe hidden on an odd facing side of a strip mall there is a little piece of burger heaven on earth. You wouldn't be able to tell from the outside what divine things are going on inside but I will tell you inside is cheeseburger bliss. I had never been here before until a few weeks ago. Many of my friends talked very highly of the this place and I had wanted to try it for some time. So I decided the time was right to finally see what all of the hype was about but then the time wasn't right so I changed the time. Now it was right and I invited some friends along to share in the experience. We arrived one by one on a  Saturday night. I was the first to arrive. Others filtered in after me. It is a small place with only a few tables but it is very clean and nice inside. Very modern. The staff were all very friendly and genuinely nice. The menu; which is printed up very large and posted up front next to where you place your order; is not very extensive. Which is good. Better to be very good at a few things then be mediocre at a lot of things and try and please everyone. I went full bore with my very first order. Double bacon cheeseburger; frys and a chocolate milkshake. The price was not that bad either for all of that food. Order placed I took my seat and saved some tables for the others that soon arrived. We ended up with a pretty good crowd. About 14 people all told. All of which thoroughly enjoyed themselves. When my order was called out a few minties later; I rushed up to the counter eagerly anticipating my delicious meal. It looked and smelled great. I went and sat back down. I started munching on the frys first. Hot frys are the best and I was waiting until more people showed up. The frys were very good. I was reminded by Meagan B that I made a rookie mistake and forgot to ask for the famous Lobby's sauce. I quickly remedied that situation. Now finally came the time for my first bit of this heavenly cheeseburger that sat before me. Dripping with cheese and plied high with bacon; lettuce; tomatos; red onion and of course the famous Lobby sauce. From the first bite I was whisked away to a place of divine cheeseburger happiness. So juicy and gooey. The lettuce; tomatos and onion where crisp and fresh. The eitire thing was so good. I almost ate it fast but slowed down a little to really enjoy it. I almost wanted another but my stomach said no. I did get another order of frys and a drink. I will definitely be back. How can a cheeseburger lover like me turn down burger heaven on earth. And truly it is. I would like to thank my friends for telling me about this place especially Meagan B and Laz C. Also I would like to thank everyone who came out that night to share this experience with me. You made it even better with your company. It is always the small unassuming places that serve the best food. This really is one of the best burger places in town. Trust me when I say this because I have sampled many a cheeseburger from across this great state and land. Go forth and indulge in cheeseburger heaven on earth. You will taste that is it good and know that it is good.,eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,If this is a 4 1/2 stars bus on Yelp; I think my rating would be qualified as a hater review...but oh well need to be honest to myself.  New to Phoenix; I was surely unfamiliar with this area. This has nothing to do with Lobbys but it took me quite a while to find and don't think I'll find it immediately still (why bother; doubtfully I'll go).  Ordered Chicago dog with an order of fry; straight forward right?  Then realized I made a huge mistake. Coming from mid-west and had $1 REAL Chicago dog in Chicago; I was disappointed by the $3-some Tempe dog; just nothing exciting. Fries were hot; but nothing surprise.

Would I come back again? Nah; not unless some kinda date who is super charming and force me to coming over; or I am near the area and starve to death.

Oh; sorry. I tend to hit \caps lock\"" when I have headphones on.  I had lunch here with my wonderful wife; my youngest daughter and my friend Donald S (not to be confused with Don S...it has happened).  Let me just say I was impressed with my burger and fries.  Cheesy fries.  With bacon. Tender and juicy burger.  Done just right.  Donald's Italian beef sandwich looked so good I'll be having that the next time I go to Lobby's; which will be soon.  Maybe dinner today.  We did chat with the owner; Lobby.  Nice guy; great local business.  Go here.""",eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,I am not a hot dog person at all.  I've had 3 hot dogs in the past 5 years but since finding the Chicago dog I've had 3 hot dogs in 2 months.  The French fries are great and the drink sizes are huge.  A little pricey for a hot dog; fries and a drink but the quality is great; service is good and the place is very clean.    I recommend checking them out if you are a hot dog or hamburger fan.  Be prepared to wait longer than at a fast food joint because they do make them Fresh.,eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,I have been here many times over the years. We came here 2 weeks ago; but It was time for another visit.  Stopped in to pick up an early dinner to go around 3:30pm. Double cheese burger with Provolone and french fries.  This is a grat place for a healthy Burger. They meat here is delivered fresh everyday. High price for the burgers but; well worth it; because; the food is great! This is better than what you can make at home. Nice and clean inside; smells good; and looks nice. We will come here again many times. My girlfriend does not even like Burgers; but she loves these.,eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Let me say... Delicious!  This burger gem is hidden in the back of the plaza and isn't easy to find.  Once you're inside Lobby's; you get to choose your burger how you want it made.  You can choose from a burger; cheeseburger; double; bacon; grilled onions; mushrooms; all of the goodies!  The patties are thick; which is important to me when I choose a burger.  I want to feel like I'm eating meat not just the bun.  The veggies are fresh and the pickles are cut thick so you can taste them on your burger.  The meat is lean and fresh.  Excellence is in every burger and the burger comes hot off the grill straight onto the bun and delivered right to you!    If you like burgers; that are inexpensive; I would highly recommend trying this place out!  You will not regret it... don't forget the fresh crispy fries you can order with your burger and I would try out their fry sauce.  I usually don't like fry sauce; but there is something delicious about this one!    And last perk; they have a check in offer... free drink when you check in.  You can't go wrong!  Run; don't walk to this burger place!,eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,I've now made three trips to Lobby's.  The first was an enormous disappointment; the last two have been exceptional.  On my first trip; I made the mistake of ordering the Italian beef sandwich.  What I received could best be described as a thinly-sliced beef sandwich on a baguette that some jerk spilled soup on.  My sandwich was soggy to the point of disintegration from the moment I received it.  I tend to be a very neat eater; but felt I needed a bib that day.  In addition to the mess; the whole assemblage was bland and unremarkable.    However...  I'd happily recommend Lobby's to anyone who wants a burger.  Upon hearing great things about their hamburgers; I returned to Lobby on two more occcasions.  On both days; I got a ridiculously large; juicy burger with great quality beef and fresh ingredients for a price around half of their competitors (I'm looking at you; Smashburger and Five Guys).    So; go for the burgers and read the menu carefully: the single patty burger is 1/3 pound.  If you order the double; you're ordering more than a half-pound of beef and you will need a nap.,eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,"Let's face it; there are a lot of places to get a good gourmet burger; including my back yard; but the yummiest burgers are at Lobby's. Lobby makes the rest look average.   Whenever I am in the Tempe area; I always make it a point to pick up and take home burgers (you can dine in as well). If you are in the mood for a juicy burger (and quick) they are way better than any fast food; but not priced much higher. ...AND they are actually better than most sit-down restaurant's burgers. Great seasoning; lightly toasted bun; \special sauce\""; and made to order; simple or the works.  They have other items on the menu; but I haven't gotten past the burgers yet.   For god's sake ask for the \""specially prepared peppers\"" on your burger; baby (methinks they are stewed and dang they're good). Plus - you know you love it when the owner takes your order... Lobby works the joint himself most days.""",eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Great burgers!  The house sauce is awesome; beef is delicious and all of the toppings are very fresh. As for service; it's a order at the register kind of place; and you pick the seating. Both times I've gone it has always been very clean and well kept. Another nice thing is that this place actually delivers as well. If your looking for a fairly inexpensive and good quality burger; check this place out.,eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,The burgers are admittedly fantastic. They are thick and freshly grilled right in front of you.   I have to say though. When I was told the French fries are freshly made; I was disappointed to get a bag of precut crimpcut fries.   And the price to upgrade from a 7$ burger to a combo of fries and a drink increases the price almost 4$ son are paying 11$ for burger and fries... Seems a bit steep.   Over all I recommend their burgers. I think they are delicious; well cooked and well prepared. But the price is high for the service and quality of sides.,eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,"Tempe; your secret is out. Lobby's Burgers is de-lic-ious!   Dropped in here with my Dude two months back for a quick; definitely not good for you dinner.   Tip: It's behind Gold Bar Espresso. Just drive around the building; and BOOM! Lobby's appears.  Immaculately clean inside. In fact; it seemed that someone was constantly cleaning the place while we were there. Just one gal working the counter; another cooking; and she was very patient with us as we ordered.   I had a Bacon Cheeseburger; lettuce wrapped; and Dude had the Chili Burger. We also tried some of the fries. Pst; split them with a friend; the serving is more than enough!  Lobby uses grass-fed beef; and you can certainly taste the difference. The burger had thick slices of pickles; tomatoes; onions; and fresh lettuce with sliced cheddar; bacon; and Lobby's secret sauce.  By the way; that sauce makes an awesome dip for the fries. Mmm mmm mmm!   This was the best \fast food\"" burger I've had in ages; and for a great price. Dude wasn't a fan of the chili; but I'm a nice lady friend and shared.   I don't know how you could think the mouthful of grease that's In-N-Out is still the \""God of the Burger Industry\"" after eating at Lobby's Burgers.   Can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu!""",eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,I'm a coffee shop fiend; and can be found hanging around Xtreme Bean and Goldbar (though not much of late). After sucking down iced tea and coffee all morning; I (like everyone else out there) tend to need something in my stomach other than liquid and caffeine. When this is the case; I head to Lobby's Beef Burgers and Dogs.   Honestly; I was highly skeptical prior to my first visit. A one off restaurant; with limited word of mouth; that deals in cheeseburgers; dogs; and Italian beef and sausage. Chicago style; at that.  (Ok; I'm a born and raised NY'er; so my bias was seeping in a bit). I decided i was give them a month or 2 after they opened to try them out. After all; they basically deal with fast food; and if If i wanted that; hell; I'd go to McD's. Taco Bell; or Jack's; all of which are within a literal stones throw from Lobby's door.    Finally caved one day; and walked my fedora capped self across the street to Lobby's; ordered a Bacon Cheese Burger; and in all honesty; was taken by surprise. Burger meat at Lobby's is fresh ground; the buns are tasty; the bacon is crisp. And juicy. All of which are vital to a successful Bacon Cheese burger. I normally get my order as a Combo (which includes a Bucket o' Soda; and crinkle fry's only made when you order them). Its almost 3 bucks more; but well worth it. Rarely will a burger; fry's; and a drink leave me stuffed; but Lobby's does it every time.   They also have here what I consider to be the best Italian beef in the valley. Hands down. Now; my opinion may not be equivalent to that of some food critic; but the beef here is awesome. Thinly sliced; cooked in its juices; with cheddar or provolone cheese; its a hell of a sandwich. You can get it Hot or Sweet (if you are a pepper person; which I am); for extra cost;  or you can get it plain. Admit defeat before it gets your table; you're going to need a fork to eat the remains that fall out. Did I mention that the beef is piled in the bread to overflowing? And covered in juice? I mean drowned. Drenched. If you're at all like me and like your Italian beef swimming; Lobby's does it perfectly.   Also; the staff here kicks ass. Everyone is really friendly; helpful; and takes pride in their food. If you're staying to eat there; you won't get out without someone genuinely asking if everything was good.,eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,"I'm mad at myself after seeing their Facebook ad months ago that I wasted time & money on other so-called \Chicago-style\"" establishments. You want real Chicago-style food; great service AND great prices? Well; look no further! THIS is where you need to go.

The fries are the best; and try a milkshake; too; you won't be disappointed since it's made with fresh strawberries ... OMG pure Chicago heaven. Bringing a friend from back home (Chicago) there for lunch tomorrow and I think I will either get a chili dog or a Chicago dog ... & another strawberry shake.

I had the Italian sausage with sweet peppers and onions - I will be back! 5 stars - Solid!,eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,"Went based on a Yelp search.  Asked for the \Yelp Deal\"" and the girl gave me a \""what is that?\""  I then had to explain the offer.  Minus half a star.  Employees should know the offers; right?  Not too high an expectation; right?  OK - the facility.  It was Spic-N-Span clean.  Shiny.  Spotless.  Looks like Mr. Clean lives here.  Extra half a star for that.  Not many people's HOMES are even this clean.  We ordered for 3:  Burger; Italian Beef (Hot); and Chili Dog; 2 Fries; 3 drinks.  Total was $19.94 with the BOGO offer from Yelp.  Nice price for the three of us.  The Food:  The burger was well-built; a little on the medium-size range; not too full of stuff as to overwhelm the bun.  Good composition.  Taste was given a serious \""2 thumbs up\"" from my 14-yr-old son.  He did comment on the \""secret sauce\"" which was a surprise to him; but which tasted fine.  ( Possibly a combo of Ranch and ketchup. )  The Italian Beef was very good.  It was tender meat; not too mushy and not too firm; just enough juice to not soggify the bun.  You could taste the spices; but I'm hard-pressed to tell you what they were.  The \""Hot\"" version of the peppers were your standard-fare (pickled?) peppers; not very much heat but a LITTLE bit of kick.  Portion size was on the large side - a hungry man would eat it all; but someone with a lesser appetite might have some to take home.  Not stingy AT ALL on the meat portion; but could have used a few more peppers.  Maybe I ask for \""extra peppers\"" next time.  Fries:  As other Yelpers have stated; they are \""crinkle cut\"" but they are a VERY EXCELLENTLY PREPARED version of crinkles.  Perfect crunch on the outside; airy potato on the inside.  I challenge anyone to find a better version of crinkle-cut fries at any restaurant in Phoenix.  Not the \""best fries EVER\"" but definitely tasty and about as well-cooked as this type of fry can be.  The Chili Dog:  Weak spot here; but not too bad.  Other Yelpers raved about the chili; and it might be good on occasion - but on our visit; it was standard hot-dog-topping chili; nothing to make it stand out.  It was not greasy; so that was a plus; but neither did it make us say; \""Dang; that's some good chili right thar !!!\""  Bun nothing special; and neither was the dog itself.  My daughter only ate about half of it.  Drinks:  Gigantic cups; with a fountain you serve to yourself.  I had the Black Tea and it was decent.  All in all; a very good place to eat.  Clean; well-lit; and mostly excellent food.  We WILL be going back.   They get a solid SOLID 4.5 stars.  Thanks Lobby's !!!!""",eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Not sure how this is rated so high by others.  I have tried it three times. each time was the same.  The burger patty was thin and over cooked.  The toppings were large and cheap.  This made the bun fall apart and the entire experience a mess.

(ROTD) and other fellow Yelpers when it comes to rating this locally owned Chicago style restaurant. What more can you ask for other than friendly service and a tasty menu of quality food cooked with TLC.  It is also nice to have a place that opens earlier than the usually lunch time competition. I start work early and can get hungry rather quickly. This place opens at 10 and is always clean and ready to go. The owner told me this is the Chicago way of doing things. Nice!  Love the fact that they use Grass-fed Beef from Iowa in their Burgers. Reminds me of what beef used to taste like back in the days. The Chicago Style Vienna All-Beef Hot Dogs are also very tasty and you can get them with Chili and Cheese when you are in the mood. The Dipped Italian Beef with both types of peppers and some Provolone Cheese is one of my favorites as well.  Yes there are cheaper places in town that start with Jimbo or the letter P. You can get more food there for the dollar but the quality can sometimes suffer a great deal. What I like here is that everything taste fresh and they go out of there way to keep it that way. No chili in a can at this restaurant.  Located in a strip mall off the road with plenty of place to park. I'll pay extra to get the better quality and special attention. Chicago attitude comes free and is always a treat. Did I mention how big the Chili Cheese Fries were the other day?

Why; you ask; is Liz B. writing a review for a burger and hot dog joint when she freely admits that she has never liked meat and her parents even paid her to eat burgers as a child? Think of this as a review of French fries; Chris's burger; and my \veggie\"" sandwich and skip this review if you love hot dogs/burgers more than anything.  Service: We were quickly greeted by the two guys behind the counter. Great; friendly service.  Food: Meh. My veggie sandwich consisted of bread; one piece of white iceberg lettuce; two sad tomatoes; pickles; and onions for $2.99. You can add on cheese (provolone) and mushrooms or peppers for $.79 each; making your sad; awful sandwich about $5. My buddy ordered the double burger with provolone; lettuce; tomato; pickles; and hot peppers. He said the hot peppers were good but not very hot. The rest of the fixings were \""meh.\"" As for the quality of the burger; it was a tad bit better than In-N-Out. But you pay at least 2-3 dollars for that \""tad bit.\""  Speaking of paying more; watch out for those add-ons. Your reasonably priced burger can become outrageous for the quality with add-ons.

It's a clean atmosphere; fast service; good prices; and fantastically tasty food.  These are easily the best burgers I've had anywhere.

I'm a freak for Chili burgers (good ones are very difficult to find) and The Lobby's Chili burger was fairly dull; featured Cinci style Chili (BLAH) and like. some sort of cheese whiz kinda crap.  Boo. Also ordered fries; and a Chicago dog.. the Chicago dog was overpriced and forgettable; and the crinkle cut fries were reminiscent of Del Taco's.. which isn't exactly a bad thing; but considering that Lobby's is supposed to be a tasty; quality burger place; frozen crinkle fries are kind of a half assed approach.. ALSO the amount of salt on the fries was enough to invoke a stroke! :x  Finally whoever dude was that handed me my bag of food was all like ZIPPY DOO I GAVE YOU A CUP OF FRENCH FRY SAUCE.. There were two orders of fries.. one cup of sauce.. which was just basic secret sauce.. not super great... secret sauce; to boot.. Thanks bro; but I don't need any secret sauce favors.,eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,In n out burger has ruined it for every other burger shop.  So without comparing lobby to the other guys;  this is a great burger. Slightly messy but really good. I had 2 and a side of fries. Price is decent at about $6 for a burger. Can't complain about that. Their sauce is really good too. French fries are seasoned just right.,eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,i went during lunch and no customers were dining.  well; i did have great customer service!  i ordered a bacon burger; fries and pop.  it was a good meal.  it seemed like my burger experience was above average but not great.  the fries were just okay.  it seemed pricey for what i got.  i will go back only to try other items on the menu.,eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,"Tried this place out for lunch today and I must agree with most of my fellow Yelpers that this place is legit. Any carnivore would love to eat at this place. I had the Cheddar Cheeseburger with fries and a drink. The burger came dressed with pickles; onion; lettuce; tomatoes and the special house sauce. It was soooo good. All the ingredients tasted so fresh and vibrant. The burger was literally made-to-order and the bun was toasted on the grill. The fries were made to order as well but since they were thick crinkle cut I can't rave too much about them (but I will say the fries tasted good with the side of special sauce). The restaurant itself was small but very clean with two mounted televisions set to ESPN. They played music so luckily I didn't have to \hear\"" sports in the background. The service was fast and friendly; I wish this place was a little cheaper as this meal cost a little over $9 bucks. Despite my cheapness; I can definitely see myself coming back here again. Side note: they also serve Chicago Dogs and Italian Beef Sandwiches.""",eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,"Tried this place out for lunch today and I must agree with most of my fellow Yelpers that this place is legit.

My burger was so tender it was unbelievable. Give it a try!,eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,FOOD  Stopped at Lobby's for lunch with a friend a couple weeks ago and had a double burger plain (no veggies) with their sauce.  This place makes good burgers at very reasonable prices and their somewhat spicy sauce was good and gave me a change from my usual drown it in mustard strategy.  The fries were decent; though not as good as Four Peaks fries.   SERVICE  The Service was prompt and quite friendly.  ATMOSPHERE  The place is bright; open; and clean.  Very different from a place like the Chuckbox.  It was empty at lunchtime on Sunday when I was there; but I imagine would be quite busy during the week given its proximity to McClintock highschool.,eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,MEH....I wanted to love this place. Seriously. Especially with the awesome foursquare and yelp check in they offer.  Just so you aren't as surprised as I was when I got to the register with the check in : You must buy a sandwich and a drink and you will get a hot dog; Italian beef sandwich; or burger for free along with another drink.  Now i am not positive of what was reduced in price but i got a chili cheese burger; Italian beef sandwich and an order of crinkle cut fries with the two drinks for a total of 13ish dollars.       I began eating my OK french fries on the way home...Yes i said it they were Okay. If they were all crispier it might have had my attention.  (This could totally just be the weird time of the month where nothing ever really fills my cravings or taste buds aren't exactly satisfied in the slightest) So here I am a couple minutes from home anxiously waiting to see how this Burger and Italian beef shall taste!         For the big moment of truth.....The chili is wiped off the sides with my crinkle cut fries( not bad not great) I have been spoiled with PITTSBURGH WILLY'S NO BEAN CHILI(SO MUCH BETTER!!)  The chili from lobby's i can tell you right now i do not believe I will crave in the future like I do with PW's.  So after doing this til there are no french fries left; I go in for the big bite....And well...It was A-OK. Probably would have enjoyed it a little more without the chili and the nacho cheese type melted cheese melted on top of this poor poor burger.(I HATE NASTY CHEESE THAT REMINDS ME OF VELVEETA) *shivers*  The Italian beef sandwich is extremely extremely greasy to where my phone accidentally below my bag of food on the way home was almost drenched.  :[ Flavor...ehhh...pass. So i saved it for my boyfriend for when he comes home from a night out. He should love it. :]  My hopes and dreams of finding a place better than five guys was somewhat found especially for the price. Only reason I do not really care for five guys is because of the size of the burger for the price. As for this place their prices are on point. Too bad they don't have cajun spiced crinkle fries. Ohhhh that would be heaven!    Until then i might have to wait another week or two to go back again and try more on the menu or a regular burger.,eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,My first visit at Lobby's was a good one. There was no one there when my boyfriend and I arrived. We couldn't tell if it was even open. I liked the fact that the place is simply decorated  and clean.   They don't have much on their menu; just burgers; beef sandwiches; and hot dogs with all the fix-ins you'd want to put on them. I really liked how they're burgers are hand-crafted and they make their own roast beef for their sandwiches.  Their prices are good  for the quality of food you get. The combo is well worth it; for an extra 2.79 you get a large drink and a large amount of fries.   It's a good place to take a family and some friends; its a nice and quiet place with very friendly staff.,eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,I'm admitting right away that as a vegetarian I am not the best choice of a person to be reviewing this restaurant.  The only meal option for me was a Veggie Sandwich.  It was inexpensive at only $2.99 and simple yet tasty.  It was a roll that was brushed with butter and grilled then topped with fresh tomatoe; lettuce; onion; delicious pickles and secret sauce.    My husband got the sausage and beef sandwich.  He doesn't eat gluten so couldn't have the full effect of eating the dipped bread and thought it was just okay.  My son got the Italian Beef Sandwich dipped and LOVED it.  If you are someone that would enjoy this type of sandwich than I highly recommend eating here.  One of my daughters got a plain hotdog and the other the veggie sandwich like me.  We ordered regular fries and some cheese fries.  I wish I had ordered two cheese fries as they were SO SO SO YUMMY.  Hot; greasy crinkle fries covered in a yummy melted cheese sauce.  Highly recommend!!,eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Lobby's cooks up the best fried burger in the Phoenix metro area.  Yes; Lobby's fried burgers are that good and I didn't think fried burgers could get better than those artery clogging treats from Smashburger or Fat Burger!  Price wise; Lobby's offers better burgers that are also less expensive than their corporate gourmet burger competition.  The Double Bacon Burger with Provolone is my favorite and the juicy; seasoned fried goodness makes me simply feel happy.  Their chili cheese fries are without peer.  They are simply the best CC Fries in the biz.  There Italian Beef and hot dogs lag slightly behind Portillo's; but are definitely still worth getting.  Lobby's is extremely clean; with a modern interior and 2 flat panel TVs that provide viewers with their sports fixes.  Their entire staff is extremely friendly and helpful.  I say that if you're planning on eating a good burger and enjoy supporting a local owner who knows how burgers should taste; head to Lobby's.  **Tip 1**  They don't serve beer; wine or booze.  That might be reason enough to take your order to go and enjoy that burger with a brew at home.  Or you can flask it and add a little something to your fountain drink!  **Tip 2**  Take a look at the wall of fame where patrons have eaten 9 pattie burgers in 9 seconds....I'm exaggerating; but not by that much!   **Tip 3**  If you can't possibly eat a double burger and a full sized Italian Beef in one sitting; order it all and take the beef home.  It's damn good reheated.,eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Lobby's cooks up the best fried burger in the Phoenix metro area.

Try the bacon double cheeseburger!,eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,I went to go to Subway and Lobby's was next door and I always like to try out new places and support a small business whenever I can.  The Bacon Chesse Burger was excellent and the fries were hot and crispy without me having to ask; which is really unusual.  The price was a little on the high side; but the food was really good and I wish them all the best.,eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Better than In-n-out; The Habit; Smash Burger and Lenny's! Great food; but a tad pricey. Everything was prepared fresh and hot; and they have special fry sauce - woot woot!,eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,I initially was torn with this place. However; after trying other places in the Phoenix area for Italian beef; I can say that this place is simply ok. The prices are a bit high for what you get and the service has never been that friendly. The Italian beef is a bit dry and is not sliced thin enough. Additionally; I was not impressed with the Chicago dog. If I pay 3.50 for a hot dog; I would expect it to be fairly large. This was not the case at all. I have gotten bigger hot dogs at costco for 1.50 with a soda included. Anyways; been here twice now and I don't think I would return. I would rather drive the extra 10 miles to Taylor Street. Once you have eaten there; you will know what good Italian Beef should be like and its alot more reasonable price wise.,eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,I initially was torn with this place.

The burgers are out of this world. Forget 5 guys and Smashburger. This place has better quality and is cheaper; which is amazing considering the quality.  The special sauce is delicious with a bacon burger with cheese. The fries are delicious and I like to mix the special sauce with ketchup which gives it a nice kick.   I haven't tried their other menu items yet. I just finished with all their burgers and I have never had a disappointing experience.,eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Tried this while in town for for business based off of Yelp reviews. Had it delivered via the delivery service advertised on the business owners website huge mistake. I had a double burger which was decent the meat was really good but my friends had chili cheese dogs which for $5 I'm sorry should have been a lot bigger and a bowl of chili which seemed more like a side instead of a meal. the total for the three of us for dinner was a little more than 50 including delivery fees and it simply wasn't worth it. I think if we had actually gone into the restaurant we would have been happier it would have been cheaper and we would have had a better idea of what we were getting. That aside the chili was really good the beef was really good I truly believe it was just the delivery service that made it a bad experience if I ever try them again I will definitely go to the restaurant.,eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,"Yum. This is the best Chicago style dog I've had outside of Illinois. That neon green relish? It's called \nuclear relish\"" and it is totally at home on top of that poppy seed bun. Son had the bacon cheeseburger with their special sauce (which IS NOT 1000 Island dressing). Amazing. Fresh beef; juicy; hand cut pickles...and those french fries! You totally think that they will be a public school cafeteria grade spud but that is not the case. Fresh; hot; perfectly salted; real potatoes and the price to feed a family with this quality of food was highly reasonable. Also; you can never go wrong with a bucket o' soda to wash all of it down with and that's what you get with the combo.  I totally recommend. Just don't affect a weird \""da bears\"" accent when you're ordering your food. That makes you the person who tries to order in all Spanish at Macayo's. They don't care and then people like me write about you in yelp reviews.""",eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Lobbys first grabbed my eye when dropping off a Blockbuster movie. The location had been vacant for some time after Extreme Pita left. I was excited to hear this was a burger place.   I finally gave the place a try tonight and wasn't disappointed. I had the double burger with cheese. All burgers come with lettuce; tomato; onion; large pickles slices and homemade sauce on a sesame bun.  The meat is high quality (not frozen); seasoned  and cooked to perfection. Topped with cheese and you have a real delight. After I ate my burger; I wish I had more!   I'm a big fan of the crinkle cut french fries. I haven't had those in a LONG time. I found the fries a bit too salty. I like salt on my fries; but this was a tad much. You receive a very large portion of fries (perfect for me). You could probably even split the fries with another person if you wanted.   You can make any meal a combo meal (fries/drink) for $2.79 more.  The price of the burgers and hots dogs are very reasonable for the quality of food you are getting.  Based on the size you order; you're looking  at $4-6.50 w/o cheese.  I do wish there was more than just 1 size of drink and not in a styrofoam container. I could go for something a little smaller than a super big gulf size-32 oz.  I hope this place does well as they make great food. This isn't an ideal location unless you know about the place; but I think Lobbys can do well with some more publicity and word of mouth.  The reviews on Yelp are a good start.  If you like burgers as much as I do; give this place a shot!   4.5 stars!,eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,The burger was wonderful. I placed an order for delivery. It was the most expensive burger I have ever ordered for delivery. There is a $5.00 delivery fee and a $10 minimum to place your order. I was really lazy because after reading that I went ahead and placed my order anyway. The sloth in me won that day. My food arrived 45 minutes later still warm. The burger was prepared to my liking. The mystery sauce was actually pretty spicy in a good way. The fries were Ore Ida crinkle cut which I liked. It reminded me of being a kid. The ice tea though is not sweetened and as a  Southern lady I spat that right back out.  Definitely will be going to the location to try again.,eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,I read their reviews and the 4.5 star average immediately intrigued me. It takes a lot to earn a 4.5/5 star average on yelp and it made me wonder; it made me ponder and it made me eager to visit immediately to see what all this burger hype was about.   While planning an office hours at Lobby's; I spoke to Lobby several times and listened to him explain the attention he gives to his burgers. The incredibly lean meat; the personal attention to each patty; Lobby's commitment to making the patty's from scratch...it sounded like this was a business that was definitely handled with some tender loving care.   So the day arrived for me to finally visit Lobby's. The directions indicated that it was in a strip mall. For those of you who might get a little turned around like I do...go towards the grocery store and when you're facing it look to the left and behind you and poof; there's Lobby's! So I walked in and received a friendly welcome from the staff the second my foot entered the store. As I sat there for several hours; I noticed that Lobby and staff treat every customer the same way and each customer gets a personal welcome upon arrival. I also like how they welcome but they don't banter the potential customers to try the food. They let the customer decide for themselves. The decor was retro and cool and I could see the burger and fries being made right in front of me. I glanced at the menu even though I knew that only a burger this visit would do; and I was pleased with the price. Inexpensive.   Moving on to the grand finale; the food. I ordered the cheeseburger and upon the staffer's recommendation; I got it with provolone and kept everything on it; especially Lobby's special sauce. The staffer suggested I take some special sauce on the side for my fries and swore by it so I didn't question the man and said OK! The burger and fries arrived and I immediately knew I was in trouble... the gluttony kind. Nestled on a fresh sesame bun and topped with thick and juicy pickles; lettuce; tomato and the special sauce; the patty was cooked to perfection and just the right size. I took one bite and was in cheeseburger paradise and I didn't even have to go to Hawaii! The burger was juicy; full of taste and the meat was lean. The special sauce. Oh my the special sauce. It's not your typical special burger sauce. There was an ingredient in there that made it just the right amount of sweet and perfect for dipping fries. I guess the lesson here is trust the Lobby's staffer! I tried to guess what the ingredients in the special sauce were but Lobby said that nobody has ever been able to guess. So that's a challenge yelpers. Figure out what's in the special sauce and let me know! The fries were crunchy and delicious; but there were a lot of them so if you go with a friend; you might want to share the fries since the burger will fill you up.   I can't wait to visit Lobby's again and try the Italian Beef sandwich Donald S was raving about. If it's anything like the burger; I know I'll be in heaven. But in the meantime; I'll just have burgerlicious dreams about the tastiness I experienced with Lobby's Burgers. And now I see why they have such a high rating on yelp.

Bravo Lobby!,eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,The place: amazingly clean. Friendly; competent (and; it must be said; seriously cute) order girls. Lobby is a great guy to chat with.  The fare: the Italian Beef sandwich with sweet peppers is fantastically juicy and well seasoned without being overwhelming. The chili burger is topped with just the perfect amount of chili; not a little dab like some places and not completely burying the burger like others. The fries; well; they could be better; maybe a little more crisp. Need to try a dawg next time I go (which will probably be very very soon). Yeah; Lobby's costs more than McD's or similar; and it's well worth it.,eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,"Took the family to dinner here tonight.  I have passed it a few times; and finally stopped in.

My husband and I shared the \""burger\"" and we were super impressed.  The pickles were fantastic; the cheese was real cheddar; shoot; everything was freaking fantastic.  We also had to try the \""Chicago dog;\"" I am not a big sweet relish person and next time would opt for the chili cheese dog; but if you like that sort of thing it was great!  We also got a side of chili cheese fries; the chili was great; and cheese and chili were both piled high on top of those delicious fries.  We will for sure go back; and I hope that they make it!""",eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,I am typically a Chicago hater because they take very delicious things; mix it up just to be different; and then pretend it is better.  Almost every place I have tried around here has been crap but I have not been able to tell if the entire concept sucks or just those establishments.  I am always looking to try the most authentic in order to make a better assessment of their style.  I already know their pizza sucks; no need to investigate further.  But; the dogs have always intrigued me.  I checked out Lobby's based on the Yelp reviews.  First trip there I had a Chicago Dog and chili fries.  Both were quite good.  I still think the dogs are way over done especially since the actual dog isn't that good or special; but the toppings seemed fresh and were tasty enough.  Of course with all that wetness the bun blows out on the bottom which irritates me a bit.  The entire purpose of the bun is to hold the hotdog; if it fails; the entire thing fails.  But; the flavor was good so I approve; even dispite the mess.  (Ted's is still the real deal for REAL dogs)  I went back another time to try the Italian Beef that I hear so much about.  It was alright and similar to a french dip without the dip.  It seems to be another dish that Chicago-ans hijacked; renamed; and made it a little less good.  With that being said; it was still tasty; just not the best.    In summary; the food isn't too pricey and is quite tasty.  Will I abandon the traditional and superior styles of food for this stuff?  Absolutely not; but it is always good to mix it up.  If I wan the best though I will stick with getting my pizza; hot dogs; baseball; and football from NY/NJ.   This place is clean; close and the staff is friendly.  I may be a little tough on the Chicago stuff; but this place is alright in my book.,eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Great burgers; what Ive tried of the rest is good; but I usually go when I want a great burger. The owner is charming and adorable; he thinks so to ;) It's a little pricey; but it's hard to get consistent good food out here; so I deal with it. The menu is limited which disappoints; but the owner says that a larger menu confuses his staff and takes away from the quality? Well ok that's fine; I just found a place closer to me that serves it all. But I still go to Lobby's for a burger :)   Oh and their chocolate shakes are really good,eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Lobbys 3141 S. McClintock Road Tempe 85282 480-897-1113  Sometimes you don't want to eat out fancy...you just want good value for your dollar and hopefully; good food. Lobbys meets both criteria and more.  Having eaten at Lobbys numerous times; I felt it was time to actually review it and share my findings with others. The menu is small; but the food is great.  One of the items I look at when evaluating a burger is if the establishment is willing to cook it medium rare. This may seem like a crazy thing to be looking at; but if a place isn't willing to cook the beef medium rare; it means they don't have confidence in the quality of their beef...and if they don't have confidence in their product; then neither do I. Burgers are 1/3 pound and you can get them stacked up to 4 pounds at a time! (yes - there is a board with pictures of those who have been successful).  Their Italian Beef sandwich is the best I have had in many years. A nice hoagie roll filled with piles of thin sliced roast beef; dipped in au Jus. Available with sweet or hot peppers it's a true winner. Be prepared to have to wash up after eating it - they drip down your arms they are so juicy.  The Chicago-style Hot Dog is a totally different experience than a typical hot dog. Served on a poppy seed bun; it is true Chicago style even to the neon green relish and celery salt; not to mention the sport peppers; tomatoes; pickles and onions. If your from Chicago; this will make you homesick.  I'd be wrong if I didn't mention the chili. No beans - just meat; and plenty of it. The chili is homemade and is never skimped upon; whether you get it in a bowl; on a hot dog; or mounded over fries. Speaking of fries; their portions are large; as are their drinks; and their sandwiches. The food here is a bargain at the price; is good quality; and best of all; has wonderful flavor. Sanitation is good; and the restrooms are always clean.  I highly recommend it for an inexpensive; filling; and tasty meal.,eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Lobbys 3141 S.

I highly recommend it for an inexpensive; filling; and tasty meal.,eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,Burger was good and staff was friendly; fries were okay; chocolate shake didn't taste like it was made from real chocolate ice cream. Going to IN N OUT next time; better food and half the price!,eIxSLxzIlfExI6vgAbn2JA,The staff is really nice; the burgers are fantastic; he portions are enough to satisfy even the biggest appetite and this all comes at an excellent price point.  Also everything is cooked right in front of you and the place is immaculate.    Some specifics about their food now: Burgers: fresh meat; seasoned perfectly; has great fresh condiments to accompany them.  Fries: you get loads of them and they are tasty.  Italian Beef: this is my favorite here with the hot peppers.  Get their burger combo; eat there in the nice clean atmosphere then unbuckle your belt because you will be stuffed full of great food!,DtFfUpwTeNkRW1dTVySavg,I loved it. Same quality and prices as every other INO.,DtFfUpwTeNkRW1dTVySavg,Great Service; Great Burgers minus the fries :) oh and Animal Style; at a Great Price!!!  They take pride in their food and customer service and it shows.,DtFfUpwTeNkRW1dTVySavg,Don't know why everyone gets so excited about this chain unless it's because it's so cheap!?  The patties are so thin they are practically non-existent!!,DtFfUpwTeNkRW1dTVySavg,Great burgers; shakes and fries at very reasonable prices. Friendly staff; clean place. In-N-Out quality all the way around.,FWpu1Ihe0oM1b9W1rFYjvA,As you may be able to tell from my other reviews; Indulge closing sent me into a deep; that-was-my-favorite-place-ever depression. I just wanted to know WHY and was left without any answers; like my boyfriend had just broken up with me and not given me any closure. I had never had a burger so delicious. Every place I go is measured against Indulge; and no one ever stacks up. When I saw this place opening; the font felt familiar and my conspiracy theories kicked in. Maybe my beloved Indulge was opening up under a new name. I have since been assured that is not at all the case (more tears). We finally got over there to try Burgers N Fries tonight.  I love the doors (saw that someone didn't like those) and the open feeling. The menu on the mirror is a bit hard to read; but I know what I want so no biggie. We ordered and everyone was very nice. The food came really fast and the girls came by our table a bunch and were SUPER nice. Now....to the big moment...the burger was GREAT. I hate overly complicated burgers or burgers that taste like they were cooked at home. This was neither - it was just good; basic and delish. If I were to say Indulge burgers were 9.5; this burger was an 8.75 or 9. The closest I have been able to find since Indulge closed. I will say maybe the cheese slices could be a bit thicker; maybe a tiny bit more cheese. Anyhow; I actually LOVED that it wasn't this massive thick burger. I can't eat all that anyhow (and really; shouldn't we all stick to smaller portions my fellow Americans?). The men can get the double if they need it.   The fries were good and the shake was great (maybe a tiny bit too thick which sometimes can make it not as cold as I'd like). I love custard; mmm!   Our meal for two people came to about $30; which did kind of feel over-priced. But; knowing this is the closest I have been able to get to my fave burger; I am willing to pay it!   One thing I will add specific to other reviews about natural beef. It is a HUGE deal; and I will ONLY eat at places with natural/grass fed beef. If you don't care; you should.   I hope they make it; don't be the second to break my heart (stomach)!   PS I am still wondering why my boyfriend Indulge broke up with me. WTF happened to them? I thought things were going so great with us. ;),FWpu1Ihe0oM1b9W1rFYjvA,"Nice location... food disappointing. Nice sunny corner location with sliding doors for an open air feel on a nice day. Very friendly staff though I noticed they had trouble keeping track of customer orders (need a numbering system). Everything was served quickly and hot. I had a double mushroom burger with fries and a drink. Not much taste to the undersized burger and the fries were just OK. I wanted to like this place... but taste comes first and it just wasn't up to par with the cost... guess I'll stick to less \natural\"" offerings for now.""",FWpu1Ihe0oM1b9W1rFYjvA,This place is a joke they think their burgers are made of gold...  I wanted to like this place but the truth is no matter how good your burger is paying 17 dollars for a half pound burger fries and a small drink is ridiculous.   It is just like the overpriced indulge burger that used to be in this location that closed down.  I will not be coming back here as I don't like paying ridiculous prices for things that are not that great to begin with.  The bun is super small;  the burger is greasy;  non seasoned and tasteless for only 10 bucks.  I guess the fries are okay for only 4 bucks more.  Then you pay 3 bucks for a cup that holds about 5 cents of soda.   I don't see this place being here long.,FWpu1Ihe0oM1b9W1rFYjvA,I decided to try this place out despite the reviews; and everyone is 100% spot on. The decor is cool looking. The bathroom was odd. The hand dryer is located on the one faucet. So if there are multiple people; they have to wait to wash their hands while you fight with the awkward dryer. For the ladies...they actually don't have sanitary depositories in the stalls. You have to walk out of the stall to the main trash to throw things away (unless I missed it somewhere).   I had the veggie burger. It was tasty; but is definitely on the small side. I would agree that it is more like a slider. The fries are good as well. I'd say they are pretty much a normal portion size; but if I'm paying extra; it would be nice to have a larger portion.  The water cups are tiny. You have to sip it like a fine wine. I was not stuffed after the meal. I was able to go to the movies after and down a medium size popcorn without any issues.   I hate to say; but I don't think this place is going to make it. I think for the cost; it's not worth it. They need to make things cheaper or provide larger portions. I don't think there was an option to double up the veggie patty?,FWpu1Ihe0oM1b9W1rFYjvA,I decided to try this place out despite the reviews; and everyone is 100% spot on. The decor is cool looking.

To me; Burger N Fries combines a clean; family oriented atmosphere with friendly staff and great food at a good price.  There are no misses; so 5 out of 5!  Some details.... The concept of grass feed beef was an immediate draw and the flavor of the meat is fantastic.  To me; the meat makes all the difference.  The bacon used on the Big Big tastes great too and the vegetables on the burger are always fresh.  A great bang for the buck!  The staff is friendly and not only delivers your order quickly; but they are there to help out with anything else you might need.  The beer selection is good; with nice craft beers on tap and in bottles.  I've had two sides; french fries and onion rings; and both were generous servings and both tasted great.  I'm not a big onion ring fan; but for some reason I really like their rings; especially dipped in some of their hamburger sauce.  (Which I always get an extra side of because it tastes great!)  Burger n Fries quickly became a favorite food stop for my boys and I.  The food is consistently prepared well and tasty!  I highly recommend you stop by for a bite!,zUGy_9UtKDfjotmWpCu_Sg,This was our first ever visit to Pei Wei. It wasn't bad; but it didn't wow us. I think for what you get it was kind of expensive. We all shared the lettuce wraps which were great. I had the coconut curry and it seemed pretty bland plus the chicken had hard pieces in it which was gross. Bottom line for me if I am going to spend that much I would rather go somewhere else.,zUGy_9UtKDfjotmWpCu_Sg,Last night; I was craving Pei Wei so I definitely had to go get some. I invited a friend (who has never tried Pei Wei) and we went to this location for the first time. The drive was long but definitely worth it. We ordered the Teriyaki Crunch Rolls; Traditional Chicken Lettuce Wraps; I got the small Pei Wei Spicy chicken on fried rice; and my friend ordered the small Thai Dynamite chicken on fried rice.   As we were getting our drinks at the awesome soda machine with a variety of different  flavors; our sushi was already finished being made! I already knew the sushi was pretty good but my friend was blown away by how delicious he thought they were. Within a couple minutes our chicken lettuce wraps were brought to our table. The lettuce was fresh; the chicken was flavorful and tasty. The chicken lettuce wraps is one of my favorite dishes on the menu. After munching on our appetizers for a few minutes; the waitress brought our two entrees to our table. The Pei Wei chicken is my favorite entree on the menu; it has a unique flavor and they made it exactly how I wanted it. No carrots or snap peas but add tons of broccoli. Plus extra sauce on the side because I just enjoy the flavor of the Pei Wei Spicy. The fried rice was quite mouth-watering and I enjoyed it as well. We couldn't even finish half of our small portions of entrees so it was great to box up to-go and save for the next day to eat!   All in all; the staff were quite friendly; the entire restaurant was cleaned/organized and the food was great and has big portions for a low fair price. This is a location that will be visited often.,zUGy_9UtKDfjotmWpCu_Sg,This place is too Americanized!  Their food doesn't even come close to real Asian food.  It is a good place for people who want to say they are adventurous; but really like to eat hamburgers & hot dogs.  Over priced!,zUGy_9UtKDfjotmWpCu_Sg,Pei Wei is one of my favorite restaurants.  They have a good selection of food and their prices are decent.  Their food is fresh and so far I've liked everything I've tried.  They have a great kids menu; too.  This location is clean and has quick service.  The staff are friendly; too.,zUGy_9UtKDfjotmWpCu_Sg,It's ok food and over priced. Is rather go to Panda Express. Try AJK Chinese Cuisine not to far from here.,zUGy_9UtKDfjotmWpCu_Sg,Great food! Pad Thai is awesome and the lo mein and especially the fried rice with shrimp fast sort of cheap and tons of flavor!,zUGy_9UtKDfjotmWpCu_Sg,good food but a bit overpriced...,zUGy_9UtKDfjotmWpCu_Sg,I find they offer solid Asian cuisine at a reasonable price.  I love the fact that I can place the order over the phone and then pick it up when it's ready.  I usually get the Chicken Lo Mein along with Lettuce Wraps or their Crab Wantons.  It's like a fast food version of PF Changs.  If you are in the mood for Chinese food; you could do significantly worse than stopping at Pei Wei.,4V3_98M4SexonrOpE4Xm0A,"There isn't much to say. Excellent fresh burgers and fries! This is one of the better fast food places; plus its dirt cheap. Oh and if you've never tried your burger \animal style\"" please do; it's part of their secret menu.""",4V3_98M4SexonrOpE4Xm0A,Simple burger and a simple price.  If you want a hamburger; fries and a shake and nothing more then that it is a great place for a fresh home made taste of burger.   Kids dont always want a hamburger and this doesnt have any other options so if your in the mood for a burger I would choose this over McDonalds for sure but dont look for a variety they dont even carry Mayo for the burger.,4V3_98M4SexonrOpE4Xm0A,I can't say anything bad about in n out... It's always been too quality food at a good price... I enjoy there animal style burgers..,4V3_98M4SexonrOpE4Xm0A,-The BEST fries in the whole wide world!! Cheap too!  -I LOVE these hamburgers; it's worth waiting for! I envision the toasty buns; secret sauce; and greasy goodness as I slowly wait my turn in line.  -Good location; right off the freeway.  -Service was friendly; just like any location.  -I learned there's a Jersey Mike's in the same parking lot; as I waited in the Drive-Thru line.  -I found this location with YELP's help.,4V3_98M4SexonrOpE4Xm0A,Great burger great fries even better prices. Hot and fresh is hard to beat. Milkshakes are also just as good.,4V3_98M4SexonrOpE4Xm0A,Prob one of the best of the fast food type burger places but way overrated. They definitely have a cult following.  I have to say the burger is really good especially as animal style (one of the not so secret menu options). It is so small though you have to get at least a double or even a triple to be satisfied (3x3 good option). So once you have ordered a 3x3; animal style you got a nice sized burger that has all the right cheese gooeyness; grilled onion and sauce to boot. (prob is it hikes up the price).  I have to say the fries just suck (these are fighting words to the in-n-out lovers). They are cut fresh but they don't cook them right. They are soggy little suckers so i have to say Fry well (or well done) to get them in some sort of crispiness but then they are almost cooked to much. So i usually don't order anymore. They need to learn how to do the twice cook method (blanch then crisp)  Shakes are ok but nothing special what so ever. I do like how they have little hot yellow chiles if you want them.,4V3_98M4SexonrOpE4Xm0A,Tasty; inexpensive burgers served up at an establishment that treats their employees and customers well. What more could anyone ask for? Hint: They have a secret menu on-line. Check it out.,4V3_98M4SexonrOpE4Xm0A,"When I crave a good old fashioned burger; this is where I go.  They stick to what they know; and that's a great thing.  Simplicity is a virtue lost in the burger world.  They have a simple menu; but each item on that menu is expertly made.  They don't have \fancy-schmancy\"" \""foo-foo\"" burgers here.    The food is prepared and cooked to order.  If ever there was fast food that tastes fresh; In-N-Out Burger is it.  The dining area is kept very clean.  The staff is friendly.  When the weather is agreeable; their outside dining area is perfect.  The drive-thru service is excellent.  Sometimes; it can be a bit of a wait; but that's a small price to pay for perfection.""",4V3_98M4SexonrOpE4Xm0A,For the price; you can't beat the burgers at this place. Always fresh and hot. Not a lot of items on menu; but their burgers are better than those at many places where prices are two or three times as much. I'm not a huge fan of their fries; although I've watched them cut and fry the fresh potatoes--don't know what it is; but the texture of the fries is not over-the-top; but they are all right. Can't get a better burger at this price; though....The place is spotless and the staff friendly. Sometimes gets quite crowded inside at lunchtime; though. It's worth it for those burgers....,4V3_98M4SexonrOpE4Xm0A,Here is a common scene at my house:   I just worked a long day at my desk in front of my computer. I come home to read and relax and end up falling asleep until 10pm after all of the restaurants around us have already closed. I'm starving and exhausted and I don't want to cook. So what are my husband and I to do about dinner? In-N-Out seems to be the perfect solution. For under $12 we can get two grilled cheeses with grilled onions; two fries; and two extra large iced teas. And when they say extra large; they mean it. I got one of those for the first time last week because its only .40 cents more than the medium and good lord that thing was large. It took me two days to drink all of the tea in it. Occasionally when I am feeling extra unhealthy I will get a chocolate shake to dunk my crispy; hot; salty fries in. What? You think that's gross? Well; its not. You should try it sometime. Its amazing. I still have yet to try the animal style grilled cheese. I hear they exist.   We end up coming here probably once a week because its cheap and fast and I don't mind eating unhealthy once in awhile. I work out. So its all good.,4V3_98M4SexonrOpE4Xm0A,"This is a good in and out. Bathrooms are clean and tables are always cleaned promptly after being used. Our food has come out timely for the in and out chain; but is about 50/50 whether it is burned - usually depends on whose working. If you go during \rush hours\"" food is spectacular; if you go late night or at 3 pm you can either expect a wait or lesser quality food; which is pretty common for fast food places in general.

If you don't; come see what all the fuss is about. You will not be disappointed. You cannot find fresher fast food and for very reasonable prices. Food just arrived. Got to go...  Okay I'm back; and that was incredible. As I sit here fully content; basking in the afterglow of a wonderful meal; I thank God that I live in Arizona and I can experience this wonderfulness whenever I want.

No complaints at all.. I will be going back here again for sure!,VeMcG5cMG2i1ziUVwQHaVQ,I was actually a little let down after my first time of trying Jersey Mike's because I was expecting something amazing from all the positive things I have heard about it.   My opinion was that it was slightly better than Subway; but there are several other sandwich places I would rather go to. I ordered an Italian sandwich; and it was good but quite standard. I was not impressed with the prices and found them to be a little much; so its not likely that this place will be a regular stop for me.,VeMcG5cMG2i1ziUVwQHaVQ,I love Jersey Mikes! I usually get the Italian sub; and it's amazing! I also got the Philly Cheesesteak and it was the sooooo good! They are friendly whenever I go in. I do think it's a little pricey; but way better quality than Subway.,VeMcG5cMG2i1ziUVwQHaVQ,"Jersey mikes used to be one of my fav sub shops. The service has REALLY gone downhill. A year or so ago they had some of the best customer service.. They would greet you upon entering and small talk with you; not to mention they would make your subs in a TIMELY manner.   I went there on Saturday and there was a mom and son in line in front me me. Great i thought! I beat the rush! ... Or not.  The gal slicing the meats who is the first person to take your order; doesn't even register that there are people standing here waiting to order. She must have been doing an online order because she was just chopping those meats up without a care in the world.  Finally after literally 6 or 7 minutes; she looks up and says \I'll be right with you\"".. Well ok at least she acknowledged us!   It only got worse from there.. The guy putting the condiments on the sandwiches was one of the slowest workers I have ever witnessed. He just couldn't get it together and took a few minutes to put on a few condiments on each sandwich. The lady in front of me turned around and gave me a \""what the hell; this is taking so long\"" face.   There was now a line almost out the door and a few people left because it was taking so long.  By the time I got to the register it was about 20 minutes since I came in. 20!! That is ridiculous!  The subs are great I love the food. But for the quality of service and prices; I'll head to jimmy johns where I can be in and out freaky fast.""",VeMcG5cMG2i1ziUVwQHaVQ,The overall experience was pretty good. I will probably go back - the only downside; in my opinion; is that the prices are rather high for a sandwich shop.  I paid $6 for a 5 1/2 inch sandwich (pre-tax).  The products used (meats; cheeses; veggies) are very good quality; but still the size of the sandwich didn't seem to match the overall price paid.,VeMcG5cMG2i1ziUVwQHaVQ,I went to the one on 7th ave & mcdowell ; and it was the worst Philly cheese steak I ever had.  This place is way overrated and overpriced!!!,BtX9mA5dYDzULGVPC4-I-A,"I'm a total sucker for Sonic. I know I know. Fast food is fast food; and it's never \good\"" or \""healthy.\"" Fine. But if you're going to drive thru; drive thru here.   The thousand island burger is tough to beat and the specialty drinks are also hard to come by. For example; where else in town are you going to find a cherry-limeade? At 1 in the morning?   It even occassionally passes the girlfriend test as she gets cravings for Sonic grilled cheese. You can substitute tater tots for fries free of charge and let those greasy little golden nuggets soak up the booze from a long night of drinkin.

Great service too.,BtX9mA5dYDzULGVPC4-I-A,"Wow.... where do I start?  Well about a week ago I ordered a burger and a side; I received the wrong burger and the wrong side; but I had already rode my bike home. So I called the manager on duty; lets call him \T\"". He was SUPER kind and wrote me down for a comp the next time I came in which was tonight.  I came all the way from phoenix but wanted to claim my free meal on the way home so I stopped in. It took them 15 MIN to bring out my comp order; but it was wrong again because they didn't read the order back to me to verify (and they never have). So I told the carhop and it took another ten minutes to get the correct burger out to me. By this time; my side item was cold. I had every intention of tipping the carhop even though I was claiming a free order. But she was so distant and lacked people skills and didn't remember the things I requested and didn't look me in the eyes; plus my order was wrong a third time. By the time I rode home; my food was cold (I even had it in a warm environment for the whole journey) and there was little to no condiments on my burger! Who wants a dry burger? Not this guy. All I can say; is the night manager on duty every time I go there looks like a punk (hood always covering his face; and I sound old for saying that; but I'm a 25 year old punk rocker myself; haha) and the kitchen seems to be stoned because I witnessed 3 inaccurate orders while I was trying to claim mine.  My main complaint is that I worked at Sonic for over 2 years; and this kind of behavior at my locations would've gotten me fired. I've returned to the restaurant business since then and my philosophy is STILL to treat the customer how you would like to be treated. What's so hard about that?! Yeah; it's fast food. Yeah; they get paid minimum wage. But if you cant even follow your recipes; common sense; and core values; you don't deserve to have the job. There's many people out of work who would kill to have a job; even at Sonic. It's sad because this location is RIGHT by my house and it's good for a quick; cheap meal; but I will not be returning. This is absolutely the WORST Sonic experience I've ever had and it's the worst Sonic I've been to. What a shame; too; because it's in such a nice area. Maybe it's just the night crew since that's the time I usually visit; but all I know is this location needs a revamping of values and employees.""",BtX9mA5dYDzULGVPC4-I-A,The food's OK (corn dogs; tater-tots; chili cheese coney); but where they really shine is in the drink department - the most important in the Valley of the Sun.

My family; mostly now residing towards the South East; assured me Popeyes would blow the socks off both KFC and Churches so I made the 8 mile drive to the nearest location.  The chicken was about the same as Churches; and dry.  The mac and cheese wasn't near as good as KFC.  They were out of fries; and several items I heard others request.  I could not find the label for root beer.  Almost half the tables were still dirty from the last user.  OK; we need some pluses here.  The lunch was like $6.  The biscuit was good.  There was no up charge for white meat.  Conclusion: If I was in the mood for inexpensive fried chicken and a Popeyes was the closest I would probably go there but I would not drive past one of their competitors to get to one.,vA9dAPd9fQt_3HqZylKfVA,mmmmmmmm....   I friggin love this place.  The greatest damm subs in the whole world. straight from NJ.  I moved here about 4 years ago from NJ and missed this place so damm bad.  It is a little overpriced; but the fresh ingrediants are so far and above any other sub place out here it makes it worth it.  Whether you get a #11; a Cheesesteak; or a Turkey Provolone and Bacon; you will not go wrong.  Wow my mouth is watering right now.,vA9dAPd9fQt_3HqZylKfVA,I frequent this place simply because it is near where I work.   I actually shouldnt say frequent but maybe more than most sandwich shops.  The food is ok; but nothing to make me want to go there vs somewhere else. I thought it was pricey but if you really look around all sub places are expensive.  Its worth a try. Not the best but by far not the worst.,vA9dAPd9fQt_3HqZylKfVA,I frequent this place simply because it is near where I work.

Good service;  average price; but very clean!! No lard in stuff unlike the Mexican restaurant next door! !,vA9dAPd9fQt_3HqZylKfVA,Jersey Mikes is ok; but certainly not a place I would recommend to anyone from Jersey; or anywhere else for that matter. Unfortunately for Jersey Mike; I've eaten at White House Subs in Atlantic City so my expectations were pretty high. I was sorely disappointed.  The ingredients were good; the dressing above average; and the staff was friendly; however; one of the main ingredients of a good sub is the roll itself and Jersey Mike's bread was way off the mark. The roll was dry; its shell spongy and not crusty; and there was an overwhelming amount of dry crumb; so much so; not even the dressing would soften it.  For one large sub; two drinks and a bag of chips; the bill came to nineteen dollars. Sorry Jersey Mike; but a cutesy Point Pleasant sign and dry bread doesn't do it for me.  I can get the same level of happiness from Subway where for half the price I can get one of their god-awful creations masquerading as a submarine sandwich.,vA9dAPd9fQt_3HqZylKfVA,I won't hear anyone attempting to take anything away from the quality of a Jersey Mike's sub. They make a tasty sandwich with seriously good ingredients. Were I reviewing based on taste alone; we would be talking about five stars.  But you can't get out of there with a reasonable meal for anything less than ten bucks. Mike should be grateful that my price-sensitive ass is only removing one star for that.,vA9dAPd9fQt_3HqZylKfVA,I will agree with the overpriced issue with Jersey Mike's.  Besides that...this is the best damn Philly Cheese Steak I have had in Arizona.  (I am not from Philly; so I admit I am not a pro at the Cheese Steak cuisine)  Everything there is fresh; from the bread to the veggies to the meat.  My sandwich is never a mess..which is amazing in itself. Service is great; even for ASU students working there.  Great location....Really can't say anything bad about the place...it just sucks when there is construction on Scottsdale road and it makes it almost impossible to get there.  (One day it was so bad; I had to settle for Rubios....not a good settle when all you want is a cheese steak.),vA9dAPd9fQt_3HqZylKfVA,Whoever the person was on shift today was so rude I got there at 5:50 (normally close at 9). Not only would he not serve me he wouldn't even make eye contact. I live by here and go here probably every other week. Now will never go again. The owner should know last person on shift today just cost you a customer. Ps I'll post a picture to prove it just so that dick who was working doesn't try to talk his way out of it.,vA9dAPd9fQt_3HqZylKfVA,Nothing special here. Only stopped inside because Mexican place had closed down already next door. The sliced Chicken breast wrap was average; good in a pinch; but nothing I would ever go out of my way for. It had semi sliced chicken heated with salsa; some cheese; onions and lettuce. Wheat wrap was healthier; but at 7 bucks it was a bit overpriced. Not much else; except they have a nice patio out back to enjoy the winter sunshine.,vA9dAPd9fQt_3HqZylKfVA,I came here completely on accident. I  wanted a sub; and as usual; Port of Subs was closed on a Sunday.  (dam you port of subs!)  I was driving around trying to find something to eat; and I came across this place I have never tried before.  Its right off the 202 and Rural Road.  Went inside and reviewed the menu; and thought I would place an order.  The menu has a reasonable selection; but its not huge.  Some wraps; subs; and thats about it.  I ended up ordering the turkey and roast beef sub.  I asked about the sizes; and thier sizing chart is so odd! Its like 5 inches; 8 inches or 15 inches.  weird.  I went for the 8 inch roast beef and turkey sub.  I really liked the sub.  It was tasty!  YUM on the bread!  I found it to be flavorful and delicous!!!  But; I found this place to be EXPENSIVE!  WTF $10.35 for the 15 inch sub; before tax?  seriously?  I dropped a few bucks on my 8 inch sub; but I guess the prices were higher then I would have liked to see.   I agree with Andrea that I think this place is a little overpriced.  I will say; the service was wonderful when i was there...but slow.  Even though the staff was extra nice and extremely helpful; I felt like I was watching my sub being made in slow motion.  I would eat here again; easily.,vA9dAPd9fQt_3HqZylKfVA,I came here completely on accident. I  wanted a sub; and as usual; Port of Subs was closed on a Sunday.  (dam you port of subs!)

Jersey Mike's is little expensive and that's why I don't come here a lot but you get what you pay for I can't think of another place where you can get a better sub.,vA9dAPd9fQt_3HqZylKfVA,That absolute best sub chain I have ever been in.  Fresh shaved deli  meats and cheeses.  I have not ventured past the RB because it is that good!  Higher priced that Subway ; however quality and quantity is superior!,vA9dAPd9fQt_3HqZylKfVA,Count me as one more reviewer that thinks this place is both tasty and overpriced.  #13 Italian ftw,vA9dAPd9fQt_3HqZylKfVA,This place is a glorified subway. Way overpriced! I went there the first week they opened with a free coupon and I thought I spent too much on the sandwich I got. What really grinds my gears is the review of someone claiming its the best philly sandwich in az; are you nuts! Personally I like PSC in old town the best; but even Corleones; which is not good by any means; still is vastly better than what they serve at Jersey Mikes. Common people you are better than that than to eat at this dump.,vA9dAPd9fQt_3HqZylKfVA,"okaaaay...!  freaking yumm!  skeptical...just cuz i am... and i'm not a big sub person... too much bread in a carb addicted world w a 5ft bod... took me almost 2 months to check this place out... took awesome advice...order the \#9 mike way\""  they cook their roast beef on the premises daily.. i'm a sucker for a good roast beef... won't eat if not worthy... sooooo good!  ate the whole frickin thing... my friend got the philly cheese steak w jalepeno...darn tasty.....and a peanut butter cookie that i wished would never end.;.  top that off w yummo iced and great service w an affordable price(don't know where other peeps think too high.... for what you get; i'm down w it!)  only problem....  i need to go back daily to sample whole menu....and i'm already craving another #9 mikes way...see my prob? def b back sooner than not!""",Q777p0iKcL-3k1171OW1TA,Things I love about Chipotle:  -The menu is simple; but you still have the option to vary it up by trying different combinations of ingredients; salsas; and preparations.  -The barbacoa beef and carnitas are super tender and flavorful.  -The chili-corn salsa gives everything a spicy kick and a satisfying crunch.  -They have margaritas; which I haven't tried because I see this place as more of a lunch spot but still seem nice to have as an option.  -The prices are relatively low given the overall quality and portion size. -The meat is humanely raised and the overall vibe of the restaurant communicates a sense of social awareness.   Things I don't love about Chipotle:  -The chicken is a little bit fatty and not as flavorful as the red meat and pork options; which is disappointing since I'm trying to limit my red meat consumption. -The peppers and onions that come when you get a fajita option are usually kind of soggy and flavorless.  -The vegetarian options aren't great; and it seems odd that they haven't introduced something more substantial (e.g.; mushrooms or tofu) than peppers and onions for people who want to avoid meat.,Q777p0iKcL-3k1171OW1TA,How can you go wrong with Chipotle?! I've always enjoyed this place and their fast; quick service. I use the Chipotle app during lunch hour to avoid the lines. Order on your app; choose to pay at the store and go straight to the register. However; sometimes I do visit this location spur of the moment. Not only is their staff fast and friendly but the food has always been excellent. I prefer the burrito bowls and tacos. I would consider Chipotle inexpensive but some may argue with me on that. However; I think you get what you pay for and at Chipotle they definitely serve some goodness! I always recommend Chipotle especially this location's service. Order all four salsas to give your burrito that extra kick!,Q777p0iKcL-3k1171OW1TA,Its a chain; but its good (keep in mind; this review encompasses ALL different Chipotle locations- not just this one on Baseline). I absolutely LOVE the barbacoa (marinated & shredded beef). The flavor is superb. I normally get the barbacoa tacos; cuz I can't get enough of the flavor; and its just amazing. Once; I decided to try a combo of all 3 meats: barbacoa; chicken; & carne asada (steak). The Carne Asada was my least favorite; sadly. (I'm a HUGE fan of carne asada). Maybe I just tried it on an off-day; but just wasn't good. The chicken was pretty tasty; so one day I decided to sway away from my usual 3-soft taco barbacoa plate; and go for the chicken burrito.  Yummy. It was excellent. I love how you can pick and choose what goes into your burrito/tacos.... For the chicken burrito? I chose rice; black beans; lettuce; cheese; sour cream; guacamole (it costs extra) and their medium salsa. Excellent stuff.  Cant go wrong. Its always fast; fresh and tasty. Again; its a chain; but that doesnt take away from the quality of food. Matter of fact; being a chain; and being so tasty and consistent; should be a reason to go.,1zaHqoc7FyzQW3idhf4q2A,YES!  I loved this place.  Had a double cheeseburger plain (bread; meat; cheese) and the flavor; texture; size was just perfect.  The peanut butter cup and banana concrete was super good.  My only complaint is cost.  It is quite pricey.  We ordered one burger; an order of 3 chicken tenders; a small milkshake; a small concrete and a small sundae.  Our bill was $22.

They're quite pricey too; so when you drive off with your order you expect them to get it right. The burgers are okay; the fries are good; the frozen custard is pretty good too. Most recent order was a frozen custard with brownie pieces.  My cup came out with the brownie pieces in the bottom of the container and the custard was simply filled on top of the brownie.  I thought the additions were mixed in. I know you're not supposed to make assumptions.,1zaHqoc7FyzQW3idhf4q2A,I have been eating here too much.  I tend to shy away from their regular burgers and go with either the patty melts or the hotdogs.  Both are excellent.  I really like their fries-they are probably the best fries I have had in a long time and are quite habit forming.  I think the price is pretty good as well.

The order came with fries; and I also had some of a banana milkshake. The Royale was indeed delicious; with juicy; flavorful ground beef; fresh tomato; crisp lettuce (Green leaf; not the cheapo iceberg lettuce!); melted cheese; a smoky salty flavor from the bacon; and a nice rich; creamy texture and taste from the fried egg. The bun was soft and held up well with the other ingredients. The shake was OK. It tasted more like imitation banana flavored syrup rather than fresh banana mixed in with ice cream; but at $3; hey what do I expect?  The fries were thin; and slightly crispy.

I waited for my food; but it was less than 10 minutes. Everything came out exactly as I ordered it. The burgers were GREAT....The price was a little high; but it was a big step up from any of the fast food burgers too. We had a pretty big order with no mistakes; so I'm wondering if they are improving since the dates of the prior reviews. I've even gone back a couple of time with other family members who came to town and it's been the same. Hopefully I don't ever have the experiences the other folks who downrated the place have had....,CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,Meh I've been here a couple of times and it was just ok. A few of my friends had hyped this place up so I expected it to be amazing. The menu seemed a lot smaller then what was online. The shakes were also just ok. For the price I also expected better. It's not horrible; but it is definitely not the first place I'd go for a burger.   Also the service isn't excellent. I think it's kind of weird how all the girls have red lipstick; and nails.

If I rank In N Out first place on taste; I probably give SNS second place. haha.  Also... you can't buy the burger by itself. You get fries with it and that ups the cost. What if I don't want fries?

All of the low reviews because of what they don't have is going to seriously detour an investor from putting up the 2 million plus that it takes to open a full service Steak and Shake in Arizona! Yes SNS Fans it costs an investor a minimum of 2 million CASH to open a full menu SNS. While it costs just over 250;000 to open the new \Signature\"" location option. Biglari Holdings took over SNS in 2008 and in the last few years began offering the Signature option to attract franchisees. If this location does well a full SNS will be in sight for the future.

For those of you who are saying the burger is not the same; you are wrong!   You have to order the ORIGINAL STEAKBURGER! It is listed on the menu as the Original also. Not the organic burger or the signature burger they are bigger burgers.  Order the ORIGINAL FRIES and you wont get black pepper or cheese or vinegar.

The skinny Back story Before I decided to purchase vehicle I used to ride the light rail home mon-fri I would travel east on university exit mill ave and walk to light rail station. I one day saw the sign for a steak and shake I def got excited as I have heard of this chain from family and friends in Illinois and as a lover of shakes. They had a great prices a good size burger and fries for 4$ the burger is def a greasy bastard but what do u expect from a burger. Taste wise was ok no real distinct seasoning on it pretty bland but it was ok. The fries are great the first time they were pretty salty but they have since gotten better the only problem is they have a lot of crumbs and fries edges. The milkshake tastes like leaving ice cream with out a lid in freezer and it getting that freezer burn taste; everytime I go back I just skip the shake but I may give it another shot soon. Service is great and fast parking can and usually is a nightmare.  This place deserves more of a 2 1/2 stars instead of 3 but they are def not a 2 I have had worse burgers and for the price I'm not complaining I have gone back a few times pretty much cause they gave me and my girl a free burger on our birthday which she gave to me :-) score!!

I know I'm not the easiest customer to deal with all the time; so when I'm taken care of; I take note and appreciate it. Many business lack this kind of professionalism; but not this place! And it's on Mill Ave! I couldn't work on mill ave and maintain composure like these guys; I have a low tolerance for college crowds and  public inebriation. Just enough tolerance to go to steak n shake; eat a delicious meal; and go back home. Stay strong; steak n shake workers; stay strong. I love you.,CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,Since I haven't been to the midwest full menu places I can't compare but base this review solely on my visit.  It was dead in the place being ASU was on break.  Food menu is pretty limited but the prices were fair. Was disappointed in the milk shake as it was rather plain. Had the guacomole burger and it was ok also. I'm knocking it down from 4 stars to 3 because the place was dirty.  All the tables looked like they hadn't been wiped down all day; and like I said the place was empty so no excuse for having a dirty restaurant.,CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,My friend and I went to the new Steak 'n Shake tonight. His friends raved about it so we decided to check it out. We were pretty disappointed. The burgers and fries taste like what you'd find at any other fast food restaurant but the other places are a lot cheaper. The milkshakes left a lot to be desired.  So we came; we tried; and we won't be back again.,CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,Not sure why the reviews are so bad...nice space; great patio; cheap prices; and friendly staff.  The burger and fries were good too!  My only complaint is that they don't serve the full menu at this location.,CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,Not sure why the reviews are so bad...nice space; great patio; cheap prices; and friendly staff.

Well; I had to eat some crow after my burger; LOL.     If you're expecting the Steak 'n Shake of old  (both food and experience-wise); you're going to be disappointed. Great location. Great people watching from the patio (which was dirty). This location is a stripped down menu version. Burgers; shakes; fries; hot dogs... No Chili-Mac; etc; etc...  The well toasted buns and thin edge burgers have turned into a bit of an average; slightly mushy; OK tasting burger. The fries are still great. Had this been a blind taste test; I'd have never guess Steak 'n Shake (and I spent 20 years of my life eating there).    In short; decent food for a decent price on Mill...  If you want food that tastes like Steak 'n Shake used to; go eat at a \Freddy's\"".""",CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,"I felt like failing at life this fateful night by consuming 1000+ calories; and this establishment for sure helped me accomplished that goal.   I ordered the Frisco Melt; which pleasantly reminded me of Jack in the Box's Sourdough Jack.  The bf ordered the Royale Burger; which is basically a cheeseburger with bacon and a fried egg.  Their fries are shoestring style; thin and crispy but nothing to write grandma about.  The burgers we had... were just burgers.  I will say this though; if you ever hear someone say \You can't eff up a burger\"" - that person is wrong.  You CAN eff up a burger.  This place though; did not.  It just wasn't out of this world.    Oh; I'm also a fiend for anything banana flavored.  Espesh banana shakes.  I ordered one from here and was sort of disappointed.  As banana-ey and flavorful as it was; it tasted too artificially sweet; in which I'm pretty sure they use artificial flavoring...  I've had better ( Joe's Farm Grill's banana shake is out of this world).  I'm just saying; if one of your specialties are shakes; then you should make 'em so that you ARE known for them.    In general; the prices are right ( about 5 bucks for a meal) and the flavor's aren't bad.  I would return if I were hungry and in the area.  It's not something I would repeatedly crave though.""",CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,This review is based on the franchise concept of Steak 'n Shake. The negative reviews comparing it to a full version of Steak 'n Shake do not do it justice because it can not compare; different concept; limited menu; different service. At first; I was a little disappointed but when I asked the employee she explained the differences between the Signature and full version.   The burger was tasty; which is a lot coming from me because I am not a big burger person. I was slightly disappointed because the burger I ordered was supposed to come with crispy onion strings and I didn't realize they were missing until I was reheating my leftovers.  The fries are delicious. Perfect amount of salt and crispiness.  The shake was ok. Can't go wrong with a ice cream shake. But just average...probably not worth the price.  The food is very affordable but the shakes are a bit spendy; in my opinion.   I will definitely be back.,CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,"For a fast food restaurant;  this place is one of the best. The prices are very reasonable; and the quality of the burger is on par with Culver's. The staff are very energetic and friendly. If you drink soda; they have a vast selection; and I do enjoy their shoestring fries. I'm very pleased to see this place here in Arizona.  Edit: The staff USED to be friendly. I see they've downsized quite a bit since my last visit. This time; I asked for a larger water cup because I can't drink soda anymore; to which the manager on duty told me \no\""; because those cups cost a little more. This was right after I'd just paid for my food. And so; my 5 star review is now a 3 star. Ah well. Will I be returning? That remains to be seen.  Edit 2 (last visit): So I returned; unfortunately. Smaller portions on the fries; and I waited over 30 minutes and there were maybe two other customers in the place. I'm done with this Steak N Shake. Makes me sad; but I have to let you go.""",CNxkXXv7NVkoLWjU7t4gwA,"For a fast food restaurant;  this place is one of the best.

For starters the person that took the order was not very friendly. She seemed more preoccupied with texting on her cell phone than serving customers. I ordered a burger combo.   The burger had good flavor and was loaded. However the fries were very cold and skimpy. The drink machine was not working properly because the choices were either out or not serviceable. Overall the place could have been a bit more clean. The tables were dirty and not wiped down in some time.   Other customers next to us expressed they were not happy with the quality of food received. It seemed to set the tone overall of this particular place.   The prices seem reasonable but should be reflective of the product. On this occasion it was not. This is not what I would expect from Steak 'n Shake. Perhaps another location may be suggested.,EuNV8_SReV_3KeET2Ums6A,"Wow; I am surprised at how far this place has gone downhill! I came in here the other night after not being in for a while; and for how dead they were (every time I go in here; the place is dead; so--how are they staying in business?); the service was inexcusably slow. Isn't this supposed to be \fast food\""? The manager was unresponsive to my comment to that effect. There was also a cockroach just inside the front door; so maybe the health department should get involved. Also; just yesterday I hit Whole Foods' sushi bar; and for about the same price got a truly fresh product; so I won't be going back into Tokyo anytime soon.""",EuNV8_SReV_3KeET2Ums6A,Love this place.  They closed the one by Mesa Community College.  Very disappointing over 10 years ago.  Great authentic dishes and preparation since I've eaten quite a few meals in Japan.  It's cheap and quick.  It will fill you up; but you'll be hungry again sooner than normal.  No alcohol.  Serves different rice and noodle bowls.,EuNV8_SReV_3KeET2Ums6A,I've eaten at this location at least 10-12 times and have never been disappointed.  The fact that it's been in business so long (early 80's?) certainly says something.  It definitely has that outdated; whitewashed decor with bad fake plants and too much lighting; but the food is solid; fast Japanese and is reasonably priced.  I also like the fact that they have a drive-thru.  I've tried a number of items on the menu including the Sushi combos; chicken/noodle salads and the low carb entrees w/ all veggies and no rice;  however; the last few times I've ordered the Bento Box B.  It offers a nice combination of flavors and satisfies my need for variety and spice.  Served in a somewhat traditional style bento box; it includes Thai Beef Salad (very noticeable heat factor); Teriyaki Chicken; steamed rice/mixed veggies; inside-out California Roll; edamame and a small egg roll which is either pork or beef.  I would also recommend Bento Box A which includes Yakiniku Beef w/ Cabbage; steamed rice/mixed veggies; Teriyaki Chicken; green salad w/ ginger dressing; edamame and an egg roll.  If I'm in the S. Scottsdale area and hungry for lunch; I will usually stop here.,EuNV8_SReV_3KeET2Ums6A,Not even for the price was it good food. It wasn't particularly bad it was just meh for the price I have had much better. Don't waste your time here; there are plenty of better places to the north and south that are better and; honestly; worth the money. Save your nickels and dimes and cook at home then go to a real restaurant with the savings.,EuNV8_SReV_3KeET2Ums6A,"I'm craving this right now.  I want my Ahi Tuna with veggies and brown rice.  SO Freaking good.  Or maybe I'll splurge and get an Oyako with chicken egg and onion with that yummy sauce over brown rice; or is that the Katsu bowl?  I get the names confused but they are both good in case I order the wrong thing.   While my friend is a huge fan of the Terriaki Lite bowl; I can honestly say I've never really had their terriaki bowl.  It's just not my thing; but I will say if you get the Terriaki Lite it's all white meat.    My friend and I used to go there for lunch and get their combos; which while more expensive than burger fast food - are SO much better.  Rather than \would you like fries with that\"" you get like 6 different options including edemame (her choice); california rolls (My choice) and a side salad with ginger dressing.  And then your choice of drink includes green tea - my fav - with free refils of course.  During the lunch hour they are always playing classical music.  How cool is that?    Final bonus - they have a drive through.  Healthy (ish) food on the go is awesome.  And what takes this from a 4 to a 5 stars for me.    Well....that and I'm craving some right now.""",EuNV8_SReV_3KeET2Ums6A,Tokyo Express defined the Quick Service Rice Bowl take out segment a long time ago.   For over 20 years I have frequented this establishment and been through all of its acquisitions; transitions; growth and downsizing.  One thing remains today: much of what was great is still the same.  The teriyaki sauce is the best (in the early days it was homemade fresh daily); the lemon ginger dressing for the salads should be bottled. Much of the menu has been duplicated by other similar restaurant concepts and in some cases; done better.  I can agree with the quality of the chicken on the regular rice bowls (dark meat) could be better; rather than raising the prices; lesser quality was chosen which was a shame. Two decades have allowed me to try everything on the menu and it is all great.  Standard Japanese fare served up quick and hot. Yum. Maybe its nostalgia but I really love this place and hope it continues to find its niche and endures another 20+ years Final Rating: 4.9 for consistency for many; many years of quick service and tasty meals; Thank you Tokyo Express.,EKVrH21lOIRrXdLf-Dt5RQ,Chipotle located at 16th & Camelback is a great location.  Staff are friendly; restaurant is clean and the food is reasonably priced.  I love their burrito bowls and I get extra everything for the same price.  The burrito bowl is basically everything inside the tortilla with-out the tortilla and in a bowl.  The food is fresh and makes for a great lunch option.,EKVrH21lOIRrXdLf-Dt5RQ,Thankfully I don't get the urge too often to eat here; but when I do I usually end up putting a good dent into one of their 1;000 calorie burritos.   With so many burrito places in Phx; Chipotle is a once and awhile spot. The chicken is always well seasoned and juicy and the rice and tortilla have that oh too much butter taste.   Overall I would say that this Chipotle is perfect for the business crowd it caters too. Nice burrito at a fair price and good service.,EKVrH21lOIRrXdLf-Dt5RQ,"In general; I usually love Chipotle. And the food was as good as it always is. But on a recent Thursday at 1:30; I was told they are OUT OF MARGARITAS?!?!? What? What? What? Dang. I would've gone to a \real\"" mexican food place if I had known that. The drink was my main reason for going out to lunch today and Chipotle has a margarita recipe that is Very Good .. and reasonably priced. I was disappointed on this particular visit.""",EKVrH21lOIRrXdLf-Dt5RQ,This place is a great location. Right on Camelback and 16th Street.  When you are running errands you can stop in here for a really delish meal.  Every thing i have ever ordered here has been very good. Prices are good; the place is really clean. You have to watch the spice it can be a little hot for me though. I love it; and highy recomend it to you.,EKVrH21lOIRrXdLf-Dt5RQ,I Looooooooove chipotle.  But Unfortunately I miss the one I used to go to which is too far away for me now since I used to live in chandler/ahwatukee area.  It's a little cold in here or maybe it's just me.  I wasn't fond of the cashier and there weren't many on the smiling side.  However; the food still tasted great.  I love rice and I always get a burrito bowl with extra rice (they only charge you if you ask for extra meat).  So I used to get a burrito that they could not completely close because I asked for extra on too many things.  However that makes a mess on me so I get the bowl instead and this place is great for filling up on good tasting food on the cheap.  If I went there and there were happier people; I would boost the rating; I just felt like the cashier was peering through my soul... not what I want when I want food.  I prefer going to a place with a positive atmosphere.  Edit: went back and people were much better this time :)  from 3 stars to 4 now.,EKVrH21lOIRrXdLf-Dt5RQ,This place is great!  Menu prices are reasonable.  The service is ridiculously fast; and the staff is friendly.  Watch out for the calories in those burritos!  Everything else is fresh and healthy!  For a chain; this is as good as it gets!,EKVrH21lOIRrXdLf-Dt5RQ,Chipotle burritos are equivalent to a flavorless monster missile burrito gut bomb. Their professional and impeccably clean cafeteria style food assembly line can produce some of the biggest burrito beasts I've ever laid eyes on.  However; it's important to remember that bigger doesn't always equal better.  Although the diameter and circumference of their burritos beats the competition; the favor does not. For a place with such a spicy name; Chipotle's food just doesn't have the piquant flavor I desire.  I need some zest! Some spice! Get this senorita to say; Ole!    The chicken is also to dry for my liking and the gristle left in it makes me gag.  I know I know; I could go the vegetarian burrito or taco route since I'm totally grossed out by their meat... but those have even less flavor! I've tried. The veggie fajita mix could have so much potential... but it falls flavorless on my tongue.   Alas; I must say that the mighty dollar goes a long way at Chipotle. Their prices are reasonable. I mean they give you a whopping burrito the size of a small dog! But then again; like I said before; size isn't everything.  Chipotle also offers healthier options like salads and burrito bowls but I don't think I'm headed back there anytime soon to give those a go. They just include the same lame ingredients as that boring baby sized burrito... so I think I'll stick to Baja Fresh and Rubios.  Unfortunately I ate a Chipotle burrito for lunch yesterday and it sat in my stomach like a rock; making me feel slow and lethargic. I think Chipotle's food just doesn't match my taste buds. I know a lot of people who really enjoy their food!! However; I am not one of them. I would rather say bombs away to my stomach with something just a little more flavorful... and maybe smaller in size.   Boy oh boy was that burrito huge!!!!!!,EKVrH21lOIRrXdLf-Dt5RQ,Chipotle...translation...Chipotle...which means commercialized Mexican food in layman's terms. So as far as this goes I am a much bigger fan of Baja Fresh across the street and after this last experience at Chipotle I will probably continue to dine at the Baja Fresh location across the street. So I am have never been a huge fan of Chipotle; except for the fact that the portions are huge. What I am not a fan of is spending $10.18 on a single burrito and a tiny little bag of stale ass chips and day old salsa. I mean the burrito was filled mostly with beans and rice; the cost on that for them must be a whole 7 maybe 8 cents per portion. Ridiculous. I was not extremely impressed with Chipotle to begin with the novelty has worn off and so has the food taste. It's not good anymore. At least not at this location. Bland...not good for Mexican food.,EKVrH21lOIRrXdLf-Dt5RQ,Yum....  Chipotle is delicious! One of my favorite places to go. The quality is almost always consistent and delicious. Decent price for the food; clean environment and the staff is always pretty friendly.  My favorite is barbacoa bowl or salad. Always has great flavor. The chips are also quite delicious. Can get a little busy at lunch (although I think that is common knowledge - thought I'd mention it) - BUT that is because it is so delicious.   This particular location has always done well; but so has most.,EKVrH21lOIRrXdLf-Dt5RQ,Okay... so I'm way behind in the times... but I just went to Chipotle for the very first time ever!  Yesterday; I got a serious burrito craving and checked out Chipotle on E. Camelback Rd.    I got the steak burrito my way.. .which included black beans; salsa; sour cream; guacamole and lettuce.  The steak pieces were the best I have ever had (in terms of size and temp.  Usually; steak burritos have shriveled up over-cooked marinated meats... but Chipotle had beautiful large pieces of steak that were medium and delicious.  The beans were not too runny... the salsa was very fresh!  No overpowering on seasoning.  Everything well balanced.  The people were friendly; the food was delicious.  Yeah... to me; it is a little expensive for a burrito; but when I have the money; I'd go there again.  Next time I'll try the burrito bowl.  My friend got it and it looked heavenly!,EKVrH21lOIRrXdLf-Dt5RQ,Does anyone ever ever get a hankering for Chipotle? ... like every other day? Just me? I'm okay with that.  First time trying this Chipotle location for an early dinner; decided to go with a bowl with chicken and of course guac. Everything was filled and my bowl was decently filled with food. It's just a shame that guac costs an arm and a leg for a little cup of the stuff. Did I still get it? --Obviously!  Chicken was flavorful; good portions as I had enough for left overs for the next day. The price for a chicken bowl with guac came out to be around ~$8.  Service was pretty fast when I ordered; but upon eating the line quickly went out the door. So I'm guessing this location gets pretty crowded during dinner time.  Will be back- undoubtedly. Will I get guac again? ... obviously. But just so you know Chipotle; the cost of your guac is ridiculous it was close to $2 for that tiny thing!,EKVrH21lOIRrXdLf-Dt5RQ,Does anyone ever ever get a hankering for Chipotle? ... like every other day?

Probably won't visit this location again because of this parasite.   Oh and don't order online; ever; they mess up your order and it takes way longer then waiting in line.,EKVrH21lOIRrXdLf-Dt5RQ,This is my usual lunch a few times per week. Cant find a better healthier alternative for the cost and convenience. Just a great place; never disappointed.,EKVrH21lOIRrXdLf-Dt5RQ,Maybe it is ridiculous; but to me Chipotle is another example of people completely missing the point.  You can not consistently get a better meal for under $7.  In my life I have probably eaten at Chipotle a little over 100 times at locations across four states.  Consistently; the ingredients are fresh; the service is friendly and the price is almost unfathomably fair.  If you think Chipotle is only burritos; you are missing the point.  If they are not busy; order soft tacos.  You get three; ask for three different meats.  Mix it up; all four are delicious; while I do tend to favor their free-range carnitas and the chicken.  Move on to salsas; get at least two; I prefer the fresh tomato (aka pico de gallo) and the medium corn (aka elote). You have hereby made your meal healthy and vegetable heavy.  Especially when you finish with freshly shredded romaine lettuce.  Also justify the cheese and super fresh mexican sour cream as fulfillment of calcium rations.  If you really need to cut carbs or some lame-o thing like this; get a salad or a burrito bowl with black beans.  If you want to turn your order into two meals; stick with the burrito and load it up; or get the burrito bowl; vegetarian; load up the salsa; black beans and guacamole and add on a side of chips for .95.  Now start planning your Halloween free burrito costume.,EKVrH21lOIRrXdLf-Dt5RQ,Maybe it is ridiculous; but to me Chipotle is another example of people completely missing the point.

(Hooray for being here 5 months!) I went for lunch with a friend/co-worker. The line was super long; but they placed a female employee in the line who took orders and swiped your credit card even before you made it to the counter. I'm sure this helps moves things along during their lunch and dinner rushes. The employee in line and the counter gals were not overly friendly. Actually; you could tell they pretty much hate their jobs.   Now on to the food. I had the \naked\"" chicken burrito. I'm sure they call it something else at Chipolte; but I don't remember what. The price was right; but lacked the extras I get at Qdoba. Less toppings- no free chips; less salsa choices; and no extra sauces. And $1.80 extra for guac?! Yikes. Overall I prefer Qdoba in flavor; selection; and overall experience. I should not complain as I did not pay for my lunch.

I love the fact you can customize your pizza however you want and they don't charge extra for it. Even subway charges for bacon or extra cheese. Reasonable price in my opinion since it will feed you for at least two meals. Taste was very fresh even on a slow Sunday night.,iKaYffwMocwIAMOU_Hj8eA,Pizza is decent; very filling! Had the pepperoni; pineapple; mozzarella; fresh mozzarella and jalapeo toppings on my pizza. They have ALMOST gluten free crusts. Whatever that means. I would love to try a salad here. I'd probably save a couple bucks on the iced tea variety available since it was really bland and pretty much tastes like plain H2O. Not a bad price for what you get overall. Nice people working this spot. It reminds me of a Subway line in regard to the way you order and customize your food. Welcome to the neighborhood!,iKaYffwMocwIAMOU_Hj8eA,Great pizza concept. Quality ingredients and you can choose whatever toppings you want and it's the same price just under $8. It's a 10 inch and just about right for one person. Nice staff and recommend this place. Is it the best pizza ever? No. But it's pretty damn good.,iKaYffwMocwIAMOU_Hj8eA,Amazingly amazing inexpensive pizza. The crust is very thin and crispy which I love.  Came with my wife and since friends.  We all had custom pizzas which were cooked in about 5 minutes. Some of us had salad which was also custom and made to order. Everything was fantastic.

I got a gluten-free crust with marinara sauce and nearly every vegetable offered..no cheese. It was very good; but I did feel a little sick after eating it; not sure why. I did really enjoy it though. My sister ordered a pookie and liked it as well. It was the perfect single serving haha.   This place is also very reasonably priced which is a big plus. You can get whatever you want and they do not really charge extra.   Will definitely be coming back :),iKaYffwMocwIAMOU_Hj8eA,Decent enough pizza that gets good lunch play because of an attractive price point and quick service.,iKaYffwMocwIAMOU_Hj8eA,Saw this new place and decided to try it. Everything was fresh and delicious. For the price; it cannot be beat. I highly recommend the pizza and salad. I will definitely be back!!,iKaYffwMocwIAMOU_Hj8eA,This place is amazing. Like others have pointed out you start with picking a crust and then you can put whatever you want on your pizza for one low cost of ten dollars. The GLUTEN FREE pizza is the best. I like it better then the regular crust. The owners are fantastic and even when they messed up my gluten free pizza twice; the suporvisor Bri handled the situation with ease. I seriously respect her and the business. I will be back and I think everyone should go here. I wish they had one on ASU's campus. It would be so nice to grab a personalized pizza.   All in all LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!,iKaYffwMocwIAMOU_Hj8eA,Awesome pizza for 7.75!  Again and Again and Again. Wow these guys know how to do pizza and the prices are great! The ingredients are top notch ! I love getting 4 cheeses and like 7 meats! What a great deal. 5 stars all the way here and super fast also! Quality quality quality here is the motto! Every new location I try and every location is 5 out of 5 stars! Keep it up guys!,iKaYffwMocwIAMOU_Hj8eA,Excellent addition to the neighborhood. $7.75 for any pizza or create your own with as many toppings as you like. All one price.,iKaYffwMocwIAMOU_Hj8eA,Ok I love pizza but have to eat gluten-free.  Even though super fast food type it is by far best gluten-free pizza. Trust me I try everywhere.  I love so many choices and so fast at a great price. Makes me happy!,iKaYffwMocwIAMOU_Hj8eA,I've grabbed pies from this Fired Pie on four occasions so far; my latest trip was last night.  Tons of topping selections including sauce/cheese/meats/veggies/fresh herbs and you just go through the assembly line and pick as many of each as  you want for $7.95.  The crust is thin with a cornmeal dusting on the bottom and the ingredients are fresh.  Every time I've ordered red sauce gorgonzola; fresh mozzarella; parmesan; garlic and fresh oregano and each one has been great.  They're not cheap with the toppings either which I almost expected given the price.  I haven't tried their salads yet but I'm sure they're just as good.  Fired Pie gives the better pizza places in the area a serious run for their money from a taste perspective which is surprising considering you can generally get out of there in about 10 minutes with a fresh and delicious pizza.,iKaYffwMocwIAMOU_Hj8eA,I've grabbed pies from this Fired Pie on four occasions so far; my latest trip was last night.

Good thing I love pizza more and at fired pie i get to choose all of toppings including cheese and sauce all for the same price.  Pizza was pretty big and very tasty.  I can't wait to go back.,iKaYffwMocwIAMOU_Hj8eA,We have frequented this location both for dine-in with the kids and take out. We have consistently had good service. It typically isn't very busy; so you will be in and out in no-time. They are generally friendly. Best part is the price - you can get your pizza anyway you like (as many toppings as you like) for $8. Their salads and deserts are also excellent. We will continue to return.,iKaYffwMocwIAMOU_Hj8eA,Fired Pie is the Chipotle of the pizza world. I love the concept of this place because I'm picky and I modify my order 99% of the time I dine out. They offer fresh; fast pizza and salads. The BF and I ordered pizzas; of course. You start out with customizing everything from the sauce to the toppings -- a variety of meats; cheeses; veggies; herbs. They also offer alcohol as well as serve yourself fountain drinks (woohoo!) You can even grab your own to-go boxes which is very convenient. Not having someone wait on you is great for those who are lunching and need to get back to work promptly. The staff took our empty pizza trays when we were done.   Mine needed more sauce (I don't eat cheese; so more sauce is needed) and it was a bit burnt; but it was still good pizza. The BF enjoyed it a lot and we will definitely go back. and most of all it's reasonably priced. There are a lot of pizza places that will charge you for the pizza and then per individual topping; which can get pricey. This is all the toppings you could want for $7.75.   I read someone's review on here that says they've never burnt her pizza; so maybe it was a one time thing. Next time I'll ask for more sauce :),iKaYffwMocwIAMOU_Hj8eA,Great food & fast service. You can't beat the prices either. Small space inside so it gets a little crowded during the lunch rush.,iKaYffwMocwIAMOU_Hj8eA,A super healthy alternative to a greasy on the go lunch or dinner choice.   The selections are all fresh; healthy; generous in portion; value priced and high quality. The staff were full of smiles too; so that was great!  The pizza looks delish; but I chose to build my own salad. It was really tasty; and I'm glad I found this place!,iKaYffwMocwIAMOU_Hj8eA,"Sadly Al's Beef is gone but Fired Pie is a nice addition to the Northsight neighborhood!    I came here today for a late lunch. There were no cars parked in front and the inside was cavernously and deserted. Fired Pie I've learned believes their market is providing \a fast; casual and customizable options for your pizza or salad desires. We use local brews; organic foods; cognizant of sustainability and the ...\""  Yeah; yeah but do they make a good pie?  In a word; yes.   This; in some ways; is the pizza world's answer to Jimmy Johns. In essences; \""Pizza so Fast you'll Freak!\""  LOL  They cook their pies in a wood fired 700 F degree oven; so they're done in less than four minutes. Nice!  The crust is ultra thin and the toppings are very good (see photos). I'm not sure if one individual 10\"" pie will satisfy you if you have a hardy appetite. But I thought it was very good and filling.    I had the Tomato & Basil; which has the look of a Margherita pizza; but Fired Pie adds garlic and several types of cheeses for a nice taste.    The cost was a fair $7.75 (not including tax) and seems like a good alternative to the sandwich/subs guys over near the 101 and Pima.  Specialty pizzas are $2.00 extra.   So Three and half Stars+; A-Okay!""",iKaYffwMocwIAMOU_Hj8eA,Love the whole subway concept for pizza. I don't know whats better the pizza or the price!,iKaYffwMocwIAMOU_Hj8eA,This has become our family goto spot for a a quick casual dinner. Kids love designing their own pizzas.  The salads are good.   It's quick; reasonably priced and feels fresh. It has quickly become a family favorite.,x3R9cU8RCFhxQdL1SPNhZw,"Welcome to Burrito Heaven.  There's room for everyone here.  If you have not been to Chipotle; you must.  It is like looking at the face of God and having him stare back; saying \You are my most wondrous creation.\""  People always say \""What's the big deal about a burrito joint anyway?\""  Nothing.  But this is a burrito joint like the Super Bowl is a football game.  You start with a giant tortilla.  You start with three small flour tortillas.  You start with a bowl.  You just start.    What you do from there is your choice; and each choice is rewarding; fulfilling and fresh.  The cilantro-lime rice is steaming when you get it and its citrus-y smell is what I imagine angels might smell like (or the inside of a bottle of Corona or something.  Use your imagination; damn it).  The meats are incredible too.  Chicken is grilled and chopped right where you can see it.  Barbacoa; a slow-simmered and spiced shredded beef; is elegant in its flavors and its tenderness.  The Carnitas; a roasted; shredded pork; is juicy and succulent.  And don't get me started on the Steak...cooked medium and spiced with adobo; it's slightly spicy and super-deelish.  The salsa; from the standard but fresh pico de gallo to the roasted corn salsa to the hot (with seeds) and green mediums; are all a perfect compliment to any and all of the meats; and you can experiment around as you see fit.  Sour cream?  Cheese?  Sure.  But don't cheap out on the extra money you have to pay to get the guacamole.  Thick; chunky; creamy green Jesus in vegetable form is what you'll find; and I swear to God if I find out any of you skip the guacamole; I'll hunt you down and Buffalo-Bill your asses.  The guacamole is so good; it makes Ghandi look like a child-pornographer.  Then they wrap it up in foil.  They hand it to you.  You pay.  You sit down at your seat.  You reach to pick it up and; after feeling the weight of it; think to yourself that maybe you need to hit the gym or something.  You've grown weak.  Only you haven't grown weak.  You're just holding what amounts to about a 2-3 pound piece of Burrito-Christ.  Rip off the foil.  Bite into it.  Taste it.  Savor it.  Paint out your feelings of how great it is on a canvas; lock it away for a year; open it up a year later and view it again.  IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE.  Ok; so I'm being over-dramatic.  Sue me; I love Chipotle and everyone I've ever known who has come with me to experience has walked away enlightened and full to the brim.    I should be like a Chipotle shaman or something; I swear :D""",x3R9cU8RCFhxQdL1SPNhZw,Chipotle is one of my favorite mexican restaurants.  They offer huge burritos as well as you can skip the tortilla and get a bowl.  They also will make cheese crisps for children.  Prices are $5.50-$6.00.  You can have anything made into a salad for an additional $0.50.  They can get crowded on the weekends; but you can also fax or do your order online and just pick it up.  This Chandler Mall location is nice because it allows my wife I to eat in the food court so the kids can get their favorite meal.  FYI though; this is not in the food court.  It is outside by the fountains.  It is a good value because the burrito's are huge.,x3R9cU8RCFhxQdL1SPNhZw,Chipotle in Phoenix has gone organic; hormone free with their meat! Yay! The stores in California have been using Niman Ranch meat for quite a while (they're a group of humane organic ranchers).   I don't know that AZ stores are using Niman; but they made an announcement today that they are going organic; hormone free. So your prices might be a few dimes higher; but BRAVO; Chipotle!,x3R9cU8RCFhxQdL1SPNhZw,I used to be a weekly lunch customer; but not as often now.  I was at CFS and after perusing the food court; I decided on Chipotle.  As much as I was craving a burrito; I wasn't up for the 1;200 calorie splurge.  So; I opted for the rice bol which was just as good and much lighter.  I noticed that they've raised their prices again....yes; I'm very price conscious these days.    Their rice is delish...love the lime and cilantro flavor; pinto beans; grilled chicken; corn and mild salsa; lettuce and sour cream on the side.  Nice sized portion which I'm fnishing off for dinner as we speak :),x3R9cU8RCFhxQdL1SPNhZw,Chipotle is amazing; and this one is no different from all of the others. Fast service; great food; reasonable price.  Get the bowl not the burrito for more food. I think they charge 99 cents for a tortilla with the bowl so it is no longer free. I was originally mad about this but it makes sense for them. Also make sure to get salad dressing on the bowl; it makes it infinitely better.,x3R9cU8RCFhxQdL1SPNhZw,Love the food at Chipotle. Usually get good portions. This one acts like rice and beans are not that abundant in this part of the country. Asked for a little more..... And got very little more :-(    . Come on guys. Rice and beans are cheap. Any other place uses them as fillers. You should try the same,x3R9cU8RCFhxQdL1SPNhZw,So...on those rare occasions I don't feel like Jimmy John's; this is my first choice.  I absolutely love that they only use hormone-free local meats - it is such a fantastic step in the right direction that every other restaurant (fast food or not) should follow.  It may raise the prices slightly; but damn; food everywhere would be so tasty while the environment would get a little break.  Win-win; thus 5 stars.  Barbacoa is my favorite; and I really like that I can choose between black or pinto beans; white or brown rice; corn or flour tortilla; three different salsas; etc.  Great options that don't make me feel guilty afterwards.    I do wish they had more than just watered down macro-Mexican beers; but I understand that it fits with the whole theme.  Any local beers would be wonderful; especially if they're looking to reduce their footprint even more and continue supporting the local economies.  Plus; it would help each regions' restaurants have a little bit of their own local flair.,x3R9cU8RCFhxQdL1SPNhZw,two words: burrito bowl.   good for you (i mean within reason; this is mexican takeout); inexpensive; and oh so good!,uZdGSJdWbQpLDsuV9mP79g,OMG! I finally got to eat here the other night and i was BLOWWWWWN AWAY! on how amazing this food was! It was INCREDIBLE! the burgers are ridiculously good; the fries are amazing; the staff is great the prices are great! ya definitely CANNNNOT GO WRONG WITH THIS PLACE!,uZdGSJdWbQpLDsuV9mP79g,Haven't tried their burgers and other sandwiches YET but intend to if they are anywhere as good as the soft freeze they serve.  Multiple flavors including a special one every day.  Decent prices; good size portions; fair prices; clean place; friendly staff. interesting looking fish sandwiches.  Soft Freeze the way it was intended to be; mmm!,azLb_kP6VHKSF0dMTfc3rA,Fresh food. Bread was super soft and the meat was sliced right then and there. I love this place. A little pricey but worth the quality.,azLb_kP6VHKSF0dMTfc3rA,First; let me say that I grew up outside of Philly and I appreciate a quality Sub or Cheese-steak. Jersey Mike's has the best cheese-steaks that I've found outside of PA or CA. Everything is top notch except the roll; that's just a little to soft compared to an Amaroso's Roll from Philly. I also miss sauce for a pizza-cheesesteak.   As to the sub sandwiches; again the roll is too soft and the selection of deli meats is slim. Hoagie's from Lee's or Slacks in Philly are available with a much larger variety of Itialian Meats.  Even with these limitations; the sandwiches are still good and appropriately priced; Jersy Mikes is not Subway or Quiznos; these sandwiches are of a  far better quality with fresh sliced meats and cheeses; and fresh tasty veggies.  The online service works great too!  I often order sandwiches for dinner before I leave work and pick them up as I drive by.        Stop in and try the cheese-steak; or a '13'; Original Italian for lunch and you'll be a Mike's fan too!,azLb_kP6VHKSF0dMTfc3rA,"Okay where to begin? Urban Spoon App pick.

If you think Subway makes good subs; then you will just die when you eat a Jerzy Mike's sub!!! The taste is completely different; it's like comparing apples to oranges!   Also; the employees will laugh and joke with you! I don't know if that's part of their job description; but I like it! They always remember me & they always give me a free cookie with my sub.   The prices are much higher that Subway; but for what you get; the price is actually lower! Not to mention that it is SO much better!!! Once you try Jerzy Mikes; you'll never go back to Subway again!!!,azLb_kP6VHKSF0dMTfc3rA,"Not bad; but way too expensive for what you get! My Wife and I had passed this place numerous times; and each trip She'd say; That place has great sandwiches.\ So; last time we were near She stopped in and got us lunch... OK sandwich; nothing special (Safeway Deli is MUCH better); but it set her back some 14 frickin' dollars! I'll pass.""",azLb_kP6VHKSF0dMTfc3rA,My hubby is a big sub fan & Jersey Mike's is one of his favorites. We were in the area on Sunday & decided to have lunch here. We were warmly greeted by the employees & looked over the menu. Hubs chose #7 (turkey & provolone) giant size & I chose #6 (roast beef & provolone) mini size. We both chose white bread; he got all the fixins & I went the boring route with just lettuce & mustard. We both made our meals combos by adding chips & sodas. What I found awesome was that they support Susan G. Komen for the cure (breast cancer organization) & were selling pink cups for 70 cents more; with all proceeds going to their cause! Any how; the meats & cheeses are sliced fresh right in front of you & it makes their subs that much better. The bread is very delicious as well. Total for everything was less than $25; a lil on the pricey side but they blow Subway & other similar places out of the water! Plus; my hubby's sub was so huge that he made it into his dinner as well.,azLb_kP6VHKSF0dMTfc3rA,Another decent sandwich shop in an area loaded with decent sandwich shops.   I've tried the veggie sub; it's not bad but they are extremely cheap with the cheese (2 or 3 slices on the two veggie subs I've had from there) but I like that they have whole wheat sub rolls and they have a tasty cherry pepper relish.  I tried a few bites of the Philly which I thought was delicious.  Husband loved their super sub.  I would make a point to stop here for the cheese steak but would go elsewhere for my cheese sub.  They charged us for two extra bags of chips the last time I was there which was annoying but not the end of the world; I'll make sure to check my receipt next time.    Their website needs improvement too; I didn't see all of the sandwich extras available until I tried to order online.  They want a credit card number to order online too - obnoxious.,azLb_kP6VHKSF0dMTfc3rA,I actually went to the Jersey MIke's on West Chandler Boulevard - but the review is general for the chain.  I second the many other reviewers that this sandwich shop is way to expensive for what it provides (approx $1 more expensive then other general sub chains). The toppings are limited; the meat is nothing fancy to make it more expensive; there is only two choices of bread and there is no toasted option. For as much as I paid for my 5 inch sub - I could have ventured over to the nearby souper salad and recieved a more comprehensive meal,azLb_kP6VHKSF0dMTfc3rA,"I wanted to hate Jersey Mike's.

We went inside and I appreciate that their menu is short and posted in big enough font to be read from 15 feet away.  What was immediately annoying though was we had no idea where we were supposed to go to order.  I don't like feeling dumb.  Makes my food less tasty.    I ordered a cold turkey sub and my husband got a hot hawaiian philly.  All the employees were friendly but perhaps because of the glass I couldn't understand a word they said.

However; the food was good; not great; but good. I got the Original Italian \""Mike's Way\"". The sandwich makers had a hard time keeping the toppings on my sandwich; resulting in a messy lunch. The subs are more expensive here too; so just be prepared to spend twice as much as you would at a subway. I would go back again; but I wouldn't go out of my way for another meal here.""",azLb_kP6VHKSF0dMTfc3rA,"In the fast food sandwich market there are many choices based on taste and your pocketbook. Take Jersey Mike's for instance. They are an east coast brand that has been making it's trek west for a few years now. On a recent visit I ordered their Original Italian w/ extra meat and a small soda which came to $12.29. The sandwich was very tasty and came on a 8\ or so size sub.   I've tried various Jersey Mike's along the west coast and they are all uniformly good; Ray Kroc would be proud.  What makes Mike's unique is the grilling of your meat for you Sub.  They have both a Philly and Hawaiian options; etc.   The quality of the meats and sub bread seem above average as the prices reflect; but still a good sub!    ***Don't forget to ask for the \""stamp card\""; so you can record your visit ***""",
